the nsa case underlines the total absence of debate on intelligence
how to explain the contradictory attitude of the french government , which on one side is frustrated in public by summoning the us ambassador on 21 october , and the other prohibits the overflying the territory by the bolivian presidential plane , on the basis of the rumours of the presence aboard of edward snowden ?
in my view , there are two levels of response from the french government .
when françois hollande to phone barack obama or when foreign minister laurent fabius summoned the us ambassador , they react to a real discovery , which is the extent of us surveillance on communications in france .
it is not surprising to read in the columns of le monde a few weeks apart the reproduction of the us diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the quai d ' orsay eavesdropping by the nsa ?
is there not as a vague hypocrisy ?
the journalistic approach is not a moral position , but the search for the interest and relevance of information that enable every citizen to form an opinion .
when wikileaks lifts the veil on analysis by the american diplomacy or other political issues in the world , we believe that , in the light of american power , this is an important fixture .
when we describe the interception american systems against the french diplomacy in the us , this is not to be outraged at this practice , it is to describe the world as it is .
france has benefited from information provided by the nsa on terrorist operations aimed our interests ?
can we lose the american collaboration ?
the establishment since roughly ten years of technological tools very powerful interception by the united states , but also by france , was officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
moreover , in this area , france and the united states have procedures in place for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described by both sides as essential .
for example , the presence of mohammed merah in the tribal areas to miranshah was reported to the french with the means of the nsa .
france may be driving , for example , to transmit entire blocks of data on the sahel region to us services , and in return - has already been said - quickly , americans can give information to the french on other parts of the world .
so the question of substance behind the nsa affair is not so much the capacity or the right of countries to build interception tools , that the question of the total absence of prior debate , particularly in parliaments , on the justification of such systems , the perimeter that must be theirs , and , ultimately , the issue of attacks on freedoms .
that is a real risk the united states ? a deterioration of their image ?
it is fine to denounce them , i do not see how they can be punished .
the risk for americans may be double .
the first is when their allies - and that was the case recently - learn that their leaders , sometimes to the top of their state , have been monitored .
this is the case of brazil and germany , two countries with diplomatic relations with the united states have soured .
another effect can be more economical : more and more european or south american companies balk , in the light of the revelations , to entrust their confidential data to american providers are subject to american laws , and thus to the grip of the nsa .
last point : the vast movement of revelations engaged by the world media , which contributes to initiate a debate on the surveillance practices of the intelligence services until then almost non-existent , could prompt legislators , including american , to reconsider the powers that they have given to their intelligence services .
barack obama receives the prime minister of iraq , skyrocketing violence
the us president was to receive friday 1 november 2013 prime minister nouri al maliki , seeking help from the united states to combat the strongest wave of violence in the past five years .
iraq has experienced in october the deadliest month in five and a half years , according to figures published on friday 1 november by the iraqi authorities .
964 people died in the violence in october , 855 civilians , including 65 policemen and 44 soldiers , and 1600 people were injured .
the un gives stock even higher with 979 deaths and 1902 injured .
the violence is increasingly lethal despite enhanced security measures and military operations launched for months by the government of nouri al maliki , dominated by shiites .
the total number of deaths in october is the highest since april 2008 , when 1073 people had been killed .
about two years after the withdrawal of american troops , the level of violence fear a new conflagration while neighboring syria is in the throes of a civil war .
the bombs hit markets , mosques , weddings and funerals .
men are shot in the street or even at home , and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
the growing dissatisfaction of the sunni minority in power under saddam hussein , who complains of being marginalized politically and be the target of unjust arrests , encouraged this outbreak of violence .
on friday , new violence killed four people in northern iraq in the aftermath of the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explosion of five car bombs north of baghdad .
much of the violence has been attributed to the islamic state in iraq and the levant ( eiil ) , a group affiliated with al-qaeda ( sunni extremists ) , also involved in the civil war in syria .
nouri al maliki wants a " global war " against al-qaeda .
the violence is at the heart of talks in the united states of prime minister nouri al maliki received friday by president barack obama , two years after their previous meeting , on 12 december 2011 .
at the time , the us president , elected on the promise to end the military involvement in the country , had painted a rosy picture of the situation .
since arriving wednesday in washington , nouri al maliki has intensified its meetings with the executive , and elected representatives in congress .
thursday , he pleaded for the international community conducts a " third world war " against al-qaeda .
the principle of increased assistance to iraq 's security is supported by influential senate republicans and democrats .
but they have also criticized nouri al maliki , a shiite , giving partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his " sectarian and authoritarian politics . "
they also demanded of barack obama that he convey to nouri al maliki that " the pernicious influence of iran in the iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship . "

the new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that it takes to smoke a cigarette .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice life of nicotine addiction .
further testing is needed before commencing tests on humans , but professor ronald crystal of weill cornell medical college in new york said that the early signs were encouraging .
" we really hope that this type of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit , exhausting all methods now available on the market , but are discovering that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches , " said professor cornell .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to develop anti-nicotine antibodies .
the virus infects selectively liver cells , which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies .
the antibodies stalk all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize before they reach the brain , which prevents the smoker to have her dose of nicotine .
during the tests , the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine then continued their normal activity .
but the mice that had not been vaccinated " were eased , " said the researchers , a sign that nicotine had reached their brains .
the experiments are described in the journal science translational medicine .
the previous vaccines against tobacco proved ineffective because they contained antibodies .
the injections were to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells in plants to antibodies .
professor crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe , could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction to nicotine .
but it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit .
" they know that if they start to smoke , they will take no pleasure because of the anti-nicotine vaccine , and this will help them lose their bad habit , " he added .
british scientists have said that the findings were interesting but pointed out that much more research was needed .

a woman in sydney of 21 years , sentenced to 15 days in jail in phuket for having falsely claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver , appealed against the verdict and was released on bail .
stevie rochelle bamford was initially found guilty by a court of phuket province on june 15 false statements after he told thai police that a local taxi driver , accompanied by two other men who did had assaulted early sunday 10 june .

google , samsung and huawei are prosecuted for nortel patents
the group has thousands of former nortel patents began an avalanche of lawsuits patent thursday against manufacturers of mobile phones , including google , the company he headed to the launch at the auction of patents which took place after the bankruptcy of nortel .
rockstar , the consortium that acquired the nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , filed a complaint against samsung electronics co ltd , htc corp , huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the assize court of the united states in texas .
rockstar is owned jointly by apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
google is accused of violating seven patents .
patents contain technologies to display an advertisement in connection with search terms on the internet , reported the findings of the trial , which is the core business of google .
it was not possible to reach representatives of samsung , huawei , htc and rockstar .
samsung , huawei and htc produce phones running the android operating system from google , which delivers a fierce competition with apple and microsoft mobile products .
in 2011 , google made an initial offer of $ 900 million for nortel patents .
google has increased its offer several times , to finally propose 4.4 billion .
after losing the nortel patent deal with rockstar , google has subsequently acquired motorola mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a market in part based on the library of motorola patents .
" although having failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auction , google has infringed and continues to violate patents , " said the conclusions of the trial .
rockstar calls for greater damages against google , because it claims that the violation of patents from google is stubborn , according to the complainant .
tripodi denies being influenced by obeid
the former labour minister for new south wales joe tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the anti-corruption regulator of the state .
the former minister of new south wales joe tripodi denied having changed the policy of commercial leases at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid , who had hidden interests in three property in the area controlled by the government .
friday , the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) has expanded its investigation into whether mr obeid had lobbied several state ministers to renew its leases at circular quay , where the obeid have two restaurants and a cafe , after their expiration in august 2005 , but there was bidding .
now it is investigating allegations that mr tripodi was aware of mr obeid 's secret interest in these properties , following the testimony of the former assistant secretary general mr tripodi , lynne ashpole , thursday .
during the years of discussions initiated in 2005 , the government has pushed for the leases are tender .
the tenants were against and also wanted longer durations .
in 2009 , leases of circular quay businesses related to obeid about 2.5 million per year , were renewed without that there is bidding .
mr tripodi , who was minister of ports from february 2006 to november 2009 , was initially in favour of the tenders .
but he denied having changed its policy at the request of mr obeid , who has acknowledged mr tripodi , called for a change of government policy in terms of leases .
the transcript of telephone conversations presented to the icac showed calls made in august and september 2007 between mr obeid , mr tripodi and steve dunn , a senior official who had arrived at the ministry of ports after working under the orders of mr obeid to the department of fisheries .
" the topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of policy on commercial leases ? " asked assistant commissioner anthony whealy to mr tripodi .
" no , " replied mr tripodi .
i do not recall what we discussed but in any case , it was not that .
certainly not between me and mr obeid .
faa : air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft ( but not spend an appeal with their mobile phone )
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phone – under the new awaited guidelines published thursday by the federal aviation administration .
but passengers should not expect immediate changes .
the speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another , " said faa administrator michael huerta at a press conference .
the airlines will have to prove to the faa that their planes meet the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals for crew members and the rules regarding the placement of devices to be in compliance .
the faa said it had already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes .
delta and jetblue are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
" according to the plan , we could approve a wider use of electronic devices very soon , " said the faa in a statement .
currently , passengers must turn off their smartphones , tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed .
they are not supposed to relight the before the plane reached an altitude of 10000 feet and the commander gives the green light .
passengers are supposed to turn off their devices during the descent before landing and not rekindle until the plane has emerged .
under the new directives , the airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference will allow passengers to use their devices during takeoffs , landings and rolling on the ground , said the faa .
most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers could use the wi-fi at higher altitudes , should meet the criteria .
laura glading , president of the association of professional flight attendants , was pleased by these changes .
" once the new policy implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers for that – this will benefit everybody , " said glading in a statement .
frankly we are tired of feeling as " overseers " when it comes to this issue .
but it will still be forbidden to connect to the internet to surf , exchange emails and sms or download data below 10000 feet , said the agency .
passengers will have to put their smartphones , tablets and other devices in airplane mode .
so still no words with friends , the online game scrabble style the actor alec baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled on an american airlines plane after refusing to extinguish his aircraft while the aircraft was parked at the door .
and the heavier devices such as laptops will always be packed because they could injure someone if they flew through the cabin .
mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
the regulatory authority regarding mobile phones belongs to the federal communications commission and not to the faa .
the faa can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
last month , mark rosenker of the national transportation safety board , an expert in national transport safety on cbs news , said that the phones were still considered at risk .
" the phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially interfere with navigation instruments , but because we know from the fcc , they could disrupt the proliferation of mobile phone if they are used on board , " said rosenker .
an industrial advisory committee created by the faa to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices .
pressure on the faa has strengthened in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .
critics such as senator claire mccaskill , d-mo . , argue that there is no reason to valid security for these prohibitions .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become ubiquitous .
some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices , or do so deliberately .
the faa has started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interferences with navigation instruments and communication when passengers carried fm radios , the high-tech gadget .
the new airliners are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the faa .
the airlines allow passengers to use the wi-fi for cruising altitudes for several years .
the modified aircraft for wi-fi systems also can better resist interference .
the vast majority of airliners should allow a wider use of electronic devices under the new directives , huerta said .
the electronic devices today generally emit radio power transmissions much lower than previous generations of devices .
readers of electronic books , for example , emit only minimum transmissions when turning a page .
but transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data .
amazon.com is one of those who are pressing for an easing of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers .
in 2011 , the leaders of the company instructed an airliner electronic readers of kindle books and flew to see if there were problems , but there has been no .
this has inspired the members of the advisory committee of the asf mixed feelings about the question of whether the use of devices present a risk .
douglas kidd of the national association of airline passengers said he believed that the interference from devices were real , even if the risk was minimal .
other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots who indicate that the devices may interfere with the systems of an aircraft , and that most of them are very old .
however , the committee recommended that the faa allows pilots to ask passengers to turn off their devices during landings to instruments in low visibility conditions .
a group of the travel industry welcomed the changes , the appellant arrangements full of common sense for travellers equipped with technologies .
" we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a pleasant experience is not incompatible with passenger safety , " said roger dow , president and director of the u.s. travel association .
the rules on the use of electronic devices on board are currently in force in australia
the australian air passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite the gesture of the united states to relax regulations on electronic devices .
the federal aviation administration has left the door open for us carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch videos or play games on their devices during the critical phases of flight , provided that they are in " airplane mode " .
passengers can already do it for most of the flight , but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their electronic books during takeoff and landing .
australian carriers examine the decision requiring u.s. carriers to make an important work in order to meet the requirements , but indicated that they have no immediate intention to change their procedures .
the civil aviation safety authority has also stated that it considered the announcement but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during the critical phases of flight were still in force in australia .
" casa has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in flight , " she said .
the question is the subject of a regulation that requires aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of security and passengers to meet the safety briefing by crew members .
virgin , which has already spoken to casa its intention to extend the use of its onboard entertainment system using wi-fi technology , was open to a change , but said it would follow the regulator .
" we would welcome a review of the casa , which allows the use of electronic devices because we really do believe this would improve the customer experience now that we have ( the onboard entertainment system using wi-fi ) on our aircraft , " said a spokesman .
qantas said that it did , for the moment the current rules .
" in accordance with our current policy , the electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing , and we have no immediate intention to change this , " she said .
the faa decision applies to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers , and we will carefully examine the faa 's decision and the reasons thereof .
for american carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and depends on the age of their fleet .
the carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices , as well as revise manuals , training materials , baggage and instructions provided to passengers .
" as soon as an airline has tested the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices such as tablets , readers of electronic books and smartphones at all elevations , " said the faa .
in the rare cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during landing .
the group also recommended that the heavier equipment stowed safely under the seats or in the overhead bins during takeoff and landing .
the cdc publishes tips on allergies in children to schools
on wednesday , the us centre for disease prevention and control has issued a series of directives on how to manage food allergies for children at school .
it is the first set of guidelines that the us government publishes , since the number of school-age children with food allergies rose strongly .
one in 20 children in the united states today suffers from a food allergy .
the cdc found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guide contains information for schools on how to educate faculty and staff to food allergies in children , and on how to deal with them in case of allergic reaction .
it also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – self-injector epipen brand is the most commonly used to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis .
state legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock .

children can say , ' i have the impression that something i piques the language , " " i have the impression of having a hair on the language " or " i tingling on the language . "
a lot of opposition to medical assistance to die in congress of palliative care
the canadian congress of palliative care , which takes place this week in ottawa , comes just days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance to die in quebec .
this is an opportunity for several associations of palliative care to reaffirm their disagreement .
if all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , very few of them would like to end their own lives , according to a spokesman for the canadian palliative care association , maryse bouvette .
if we focused on palliative care in canada , the approach of euthanasia would be minimal .
the chair of the network of palliative care in quebec also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die .
if it is adopted , alberta déry is concerned about the impact on future generations .
" what is the meaning of life , " she laments .
the majority of palliative care homes refuse to help patients die , according to the vice-president of the alliance of hospices , suzanne fitzback .
mrs fitzback , also director of the maison mathieu-froment-savoie gatineau , believes that the service would be unnecessary .
we never asks : " i want to die , give me an injection . "
the director of the association of palliative care in ontario , rick firth , believes that the bill of quebec misleads people about the vocation of palliative care .
he does not believe that ontario will follow .
for its part , the liberal member of parliament for gatineau , stephanie valle , says that the concept of end of life should be clarified before the bill is adopted .
halloween 2013 : in figures
when i was small , halloween was magical .
my sister and i were allowed to eat sweets , to go to bed late and get us to go in the vicinity .
today , i have become more stingy .
in the last two years , i have not distributed a single candy and i will certainly not more this year .
but the stats show that i am the black sheep when it comes to halloween .
the majority of americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion in candy , costumes and decorations , according to the national retail federation .

for men , i expect to see many zombies , thanks to the tv series the walking dead , and i bet that the men in the area of daft punk will be among our photos instagram this year .
according to google , the most wanted are the disguises , batman zombies , pirates and witches .
i suppose it is not difficult to remain traditional .
we disguised our dogs last year and , to my astonishment , they were not alone .
in fact , americans will spend $ 330 million on pet costumes this year , according to the nrf .
this is a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs .
when it comes to candy , it does not pile .
americans will spend $ 1.9 billion on candy this year , according to the firm nielsen .
this represents approximately 272 million kg of hershey bars , pacifiers , milk duds , twizzlers and clark bars .
it is a new super for the 41 million children who go hunting candy in their neighborhoods , according to the u.s. department of commerce .
in fact , we are going to buy , and we do not tell stories , consume 41 million kg of chocolate during halloween .
candy corn is the only thing that we do not want to eat ; and yet almost 16 million kg sold for halloween , according to the national confectioners association .
this represents approximately 9 billion corn kernels .
it is a mystery that i am not yet arrived .
nothing is more representative of the halloween haunted houses .
they are the best names , like " terror behind the walls " ( which is actually a real prison ) , " howl-o-scream " and " the house of shock . "
in fact , there are 1200 haunted houses officially recognized in the united states , generating about $ 500 million in revenue , according to the america haunts , and this includes these wonderful photos of you peed on you that your friends are on facebook and that you cannot remove and on which a type that you like to leave a comment of " lovely style head . "
finally , talk about pumpkins .
charlie brown has presented the grosse citrouille when we were kids , and carving a pumpkin-shaped lantern , it is like decorating a christmas tree – it is something that we do since it is very small .
fortunately for us , " the tendency of the baby-pumpkin " began only last year through pinterest , so most of us have carved the pumpkins and did not have to sit in it .
this year , americans will spend approximately $ 106m in pumpkins , according to the u.s. census bureau .
the pumpkin lantern that wither slowly on the porch of your home strays of illinois , where 542 million pumpkins have been cultivated this year .
if you seek out more , call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california , and try to sculpt their pumpkin 922 kg .

diehard fans of the m23 , a few hundred fighters were dug in almost 2000 metres on the agricultural hills , chanzu and runyonyi mbuzi , relatives of bunagana and jomba , two locales at approximately 80 km north of goma , the capital of north kivu province .
" it has not stopped since this morning , the fighting continued despite the night , " told afp an inhabitant of jomba , contacted by telephone around 12.30 , and that a girl was shot and injured in the morning .
" the intensity of clashes has declined a bit , " he added , " it seems that the fardc armed forces of the drc have pushed a little rebel . "
according to this witness wishing to remain anonymous , the soldiers had " spent the night at jomba " before getting to the front for a " sweep operation " .
there was very much behind him crackling fed arms .
in bunagana , political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion on wednesday , an afp journalist could hear detonations from heavy weapons .
according to a source at the united nations mission for the stabilisation of the drc , the fighting came " in a final phase , " the fardc " circled the positions of the residual to dislodge the m23 . "
since the resumption on friday , clashes between the mouvement du 23 mars ( § m § 2 § 3 § ) and the army , the monusco is not directly involved in the fighting , but it provides the government troops a crucial intelligence support , monitoring and planning .
in late afternoon , several dozen soldiers , well supplied with ammunition , rode toward the front line .
they were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers .
earlier , on the road to bunagana , a border post with uganda , the military helped civilians directing a multiple rocket launchers mounted on a truck brand nine fardc to relieve another gear pounding the positions of the m23 on the hills .
the congolese president , joseph kabila , called on wednesday night once again the rebels to " demobilize " voluntarily or be disarmed " by force , " but the process has left open in kampala , kinshasa and the m23 discussed since december without result for the moment .
on the ground , the political leaders of the m23 hope to reach an agreement .
" we ended the talks , it only remains to the ugandan mediation to organise the signing , " said roger lumbala , vice-president of the m23 delegation , without this information can be confirmed immediately on the government side .
the m23 was born a mutiny in april 2012 , former rebels , mainly tutsis , integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
the un and kinshasa regularly accuses uganda and rwanda of supporting the m23 , which refute kigali and kampala .
north kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the drc , and its basement is full of coveted mining resources .
in bunagana , the ugandan side of the border , where fled about 5000 people between monday and wednesday , according to the un , the movement back to the drc which had started in the morning was reversed in mid-day .
" this morning we retraversé to go in our fields , but the military told us to retreat , " said afp imelda nyirankusi , surrounded by her nine children , including an infant on the back .
one has the impression that the shots are close to the populations .
in the early evening , dozens of people were crossing the border , some with a mattress on the head , to spend the night in uganda .
the israeli army kills a hamas member in gaza-sces
fire from israeli tanks killed thursday an islamist militant hamas palestinian and seriously wounded another in the south of the gaza strip , it was learned after sources of health services .
a hamas source said that fighting broke out in the area , as israeli tanks crossed the border and were covered by your rocket palestinian mortars .
the israeli army has merely mention a " targeted action " in the area near a tunnel called " terrorist " by israel , dug at the border and whose discovery was announced mid-october .
the concern for security in mozambique grows along with disputes among powerful personalities
at the foot of the statue of samora machel , mozambique 's founding president , takes visitors , thousands of people gathered in the center of maputo for chanting peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration .
" we want to restore peace ; we want stability , " said vanessa de sousa , general director of an investment company .
concerned about the future of his country , it has exchanged its working clothes against a t-shirt bearing the words " we want security " in portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on independence square in the capital on thursday .
for two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and renamo , the worst clashes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years .
the renamo was once a famous rebel movement , initially supported by rhodesia governed by then the white apartheid government of south africa in the framework of efforts to destabilize the government of an independent country .
after a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it has become an opposition party .
analysts believe that the country should not fall back into an open conflict , but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population .
the stakes are high for the growing economy since the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $ 50 billion investment over the next few years from companies like rio tinto , vale of brazil , eni of italy and anadarko of the united states .
the frelimo , the ruling party and the main political force since 1975 , and the renamo is mutually blame the tensions .
the renamo says that the government is behind the recent clashes and that it has launched an attack on its members in the province of sofala , a traditional bastion of the renamo , on 17 october .
the assaults on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked the bases of the renamo and tried to kill afonso dhlakama , the leader of the group , and fernando mazanga , the spokesperson for the renamo , according to the financial times .
the government makes the renamo responsible for triggering the conflict , and accuses him of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability .
mr guebuza said wednesday to afp , the french news agency , that mr dhlakama is regarded as a " loser " who wanted to use " all the forces that he had to try to prove that it could impose its decisions to the government . "
the frelimo and renamo insist they both want to avoid war .
but the concern grew after mr mazanga said that renamo was abandoning the peace agreement in 1992 .
he told the ft that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the frelimo .
" we want to resume negotiations , but with the utmost seriousness , " said mr mazanga .
previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year .
" they are two great men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) that do not stop arguing , " said joseph hanlon , a speaker from the open university and a specialist in mozambique .
none of them knows negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions .
the renamo , who is in favour of electoral reform , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in november .
the presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year .
some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to get concessions and a war chest from the government .
the share of votes collected by the renamo continues to drop since 1992 , while a new party , the democratic movement of mozambique ( mdm ) , which was created by a former member of the renamo , should get a greater number of votes in elections .
mr mazanga said that mr guebuza – which should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
" it does not want a multiparty democracy , it does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , " said mr mazanga .
we do not know exactly what is the capacity of the renamo , but she has conducted flash disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a motorway north-south axis .
most clashes have occurred in the province of sofala , which is located several hundred kilometres north of maputo , but where is the beira port where mining companies including rio tinto and vale , export coal .
in june , rio has not been able to use the railways for about a week after the renamo has threatened to attack the rail line .
mr mazanga was falsely shy when asked if the renamo réitèrerait this threat .
the renamo wanted to " warn the international community that things are not going well in mozambique , " said mr mazanga .
the instability has strengthened the frustrations about the government , says fernando lima , director of mediacoop , a society of independent media , many people are also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and the recent wave of kidnappings .
" people think that the future of the country are the government and the president , and that it is to find solutions to problems , " he said .
omar sultuane , a protester , said that people only wanted stability .
" nobody cares about the renamo and frelimo , they just want to regain peace , they want to have free access to the roads , " he added .

coulson has used the telephone hacking to verify a pipe
the former editor of news of the world , andy coulson would have used " the phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation " in an attempt to confirm a phony hose on a route involving interior minister then , charles clarke .
prosecutor andrew edis qc told the court at the old bailey that news of the world had heard a false rumour in may 2005 that clarke had a relationship with hannah pawlby , his " pretty special advisor . "
it has been reported to the court that the newspaper asked glenn mulcaire , a private detective to hack voicemail to pawlby and " planted in front of his door , " but coulson has also called and left voice messages .
" the charge suggests that mr coulson , who is now the editor of notw , is not the kind of man to stay in front of the house people hoping the surprise , it is the kind of man to love present history for people to see what they say , " said mr edis .
he said that notw used three ways to investigate the subjects : the phone hacking , surveillance and confrontation .
the editor is personally involved in the third .
it is obvious that it is aware of the second , surveillance , it cannot be otherwise .
but what about the first ?
he has knowledge of phone hacking ?
he says the opposite , but we say " of course if . "
the rumors on a route involving clarke have been occasions in the first by the office of the editor of notw when a source , experiencing a sexual attraction to miss pawlby , said that he was told : " do not waste your time with it , it is with charles . "
a band , which were recorded voicemail hacked on his phone at least three times , was seized at the home of mulcaire in august 2006 .
investigators have also found on the computer seized from private detective miss pawlby and his sister were placed in a folder " projects " .
during the period in which the detective has investigated it , grandparents of miss pawlby received anonymous calls asked them about it , mr edis said .
meanwhile , the former chief reporter neville thurlbeck and former reporter james weatherup oversaw the monitoring of movements of miss pawlby .
in a voicemail message he left on 18 june 2005 , coulson said : " i have a story that we intend to publish tomorrow that i would really like to talk to charles . "
mr edis explained that the involvement of coulson in history has followed the same pattern as other important men , such as former interior minister david blunkett .
the jury heard thursday that coulson had confronted mr blunkett about a liaison with a married woman while he was attending the co-defendant rebekah brooks , who was also married at the time .
coulson and brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between october 3 2000 and august 9 2006 .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup have admitted having made the phone hacking .
rescue plan of $ 325 million for the health system of tasmania
the federal government maintains that the rescue plan of $ 325 million for the health system , which is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the state government not wasted funds .
the federal health minister tanya plibersek announced that the commonwealth is taking " urgent measures " to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the population of the island state , the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system .
the funding over four years , was decided after consultations with the independent tasmanian mp andrew wilkie .
" the government has proposed an emergency rescue plan , which we believe will address the unique challenges the state faces , " ms plibersek said today .
the $ 325 million plan included $ 31 million for elective surgery .
2600 additional operations , especially in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract , will help to catch up .
funds are also planned for the walk-in clinics in hobart and launceston , better care , external training frameworks , medical services dedicated to mental health and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals .
" these investments respond to the idea that , according to front-line clinicians , it is the best way to treat the health system of tasmania , " ms plibersek said .
the minister said that the government of tasmania would be confronted with a strict regime of reporting and accountability .
the state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the areas where it spends the extra funds .
a panel of three people will be established to ensure that the state provides the most effective and efficient way possible .
mr wilkie said today that the $ 325 million do not count for much " unless they are followed by a genuine reform to strengthen the public health system of tasmania . "
he applauded the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance he has presented to the prime minister in early may .
" i hope that the federal assistance will contribute greatly to withdraw the public health system of tasmania from the black list , " mr wilkie said .
according to the state government , these additional elective procedures largely reverses the recent cuts .
but the spokesman for the opposition health peter dutton believes that today 's announcement is " a makeshift solution . "
" the reason why we are here is that the labour government of the state withdrew $ 430 million of its health system , " he said on abc tv .
we cannot have a government of the state which tears almost half a billion dollars and the commonwealth , which is $ 300 million , and pretend that it is a good day .
mr dutton has visited ms plibersek to ensure that no dollar rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy .
he walks through the mud , the jungle and crossed rivers to provide free medical assistance
dr. georges bwelle provides free health care in the villages of cameroon
dr. bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
there are not many doctors in this west african country , barely 1 per 5000 .
vote here or via your mobile device
dr. georges bwelle is one of 10 cnn heroes of 2013 .
you can vote for him , or one of the 10 other heroes , to elect the cnn " hero of the year . "
this person will receive $ 250000 to continue its extraordinary work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle watched his father ill alternating periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and visit hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
jamef bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near yaounde , the capital of cameroon .
initially , he had only a broken arm , but he contracted an infection that has spread to his brain , creating a hematoma that he would be the legacy the rest of his life .
" there was no neurosurgeons in cameroon , " said georges bwelle .
we would taken abroad if we had enough money .
instead , dr. bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals for any treatment that he could benefit .
" it is not easy , " says bwelle .
you can leave the house at 5.00 a.m. , you rush to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
there are many patients .
people can die because they wait too long .
the situation has not changed much since the death of the father of dr. bwelle in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for 5000 people , according to the world health organization .
in comparison , the u.s. ratio is 1 doctor for 413 people .
and even if they could see a doctor , many cameroonians may not pay for the consultation .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three-quarters of the country 's health expenditures are made in the private sector .
" the only problem they have is poverty , " said dr. bwelle .
and because of poverty , they cannot enjoy life .
after seeing his father and his countrymen suffer , dr. bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things .
dr. georges bwelle and his team of volunteers have practiced more than 700 surgical acts for free over the last year .
he became a doctor himself , working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of yaounde .
and it has created a humanitarian non-profit association , ascovime , who travels to rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care .
since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32000 people .
almost every friday , with some 30 people , they huddle in vans after the medical equipment on the roof and traverse difficult terrain to the villages that need help the most .
luck does not always .
they have repeatedly pushed the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks .
but when they arrive , they are received as a hero : the community organizes a feast , sing and dance and offers them the best available housing .
in these villages , the free health care is a good reason to celebrate , and dr. bwelle – with his big smile and boundless energy – is more than happy to join in the festivities .
the next morning , the team starts to receive hundreds of patients .
" we get 500 people at each visit , " said mr bwelle .
sometimes they live to 60 km from the village , and they come on foot .
in this mobile hospital , various health care is provided .
many people receive treatment against malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , sexually transmitted diseases and pests .
others may receive crutches , a pair of glasses collected or a certificate of birth – free document needed to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
in the evening , the team practice of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia .
the operations are usually performed in a school , a mayor or a house ; after the intervention , the patient gets up and goes in the recovery room to let its place to the next person .
thanks to the lighting of the generator , the operating room and sterilizing equipment , dr. bwelle and work until the early hours of sunday morning .
it is a grueling pace , but musicians villages generally help the team to stay motivated .
" they are knocking on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work , " explained mr bwelle .
on sunday , the team returned to the city , tired but proud of the work she has done .
the group , composed of cameroonian doctors and medical students , has practiced 700 surgical acts for free over the last year , and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they support .
a man explained that the free operation that he had to treat a hernia would allow him to work again .
" it is going to change my future and that of my family , " said the man .
in addition to live this mobile hospital and work as a surgeon at the hospital , dr. bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around yaoundé .
this is the second job , he explains , which finances its association with 60 % ; the rest is covered by private donations .
" i do not know when he sleeps , " said katie o ' malley , a medical student in second year of the drexel university in philadelphia and volunteer within the group of dr. bwelle .
it is still in the hospital or trying to find money for its association in order to conduct these campaigns .
for medical students and nursing students like katie o ' malley , who come from the united states and europe to join mr bwelle in its missions , it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they have no home .
" we were able to participate in operations to help stanch the blood or get the instruments to dr. bwelle , " explained miss o ' malley .
this is not something that you have the opportunity to do in america when you are a medical student in second year .
volunteer students generally pay their journey in cameroon , and often arrive with medical equipment collected .
but once in yaoundé , their pensions , transport and education are borne by dr. bwelle .
" it is a hero , there is no doubt , " said katie o ' malley .
he gives his life for this association , and his desire to help the people of cameroon is not abate .
for dr. bwelle , workload relatively constant is not a difficulty .
helping others to live happily with the promise he made to his father is something that she is a great joy .
" i am so happy when i do this work , " added mr bwelle .
and i think of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
making people laugh and pain are the reasons that lead me to do that .

we are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with land rover and the msa , and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try different forms of rallies in the uk and internationally , and to prepare for the rigors and realities raids rallies .
we had a lot of pleasure to develop the vehicle of the defender challenge – the championship will be really exciting . "
in addition , the defender challenge will propose a day of training and testing in february and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of north africa and the middle east .
the two france pierre nora
perplexed , academics have long struggled to define and situate pierre nora .
professor in lecture theatres and classrooms ?
no doubt , but by highlighting its low for the paths , sciences-po , hautes etudes .
arbitrator works of others in his office on the rue gaston-gallimard ?
in fact , but ignoring the work hidden underground and the writing of the publisher .
heir of the wheelchair occupied fontenelle to the académie française ?
still , but knowing that such a coronation cannot replace the real holy oil , the thesis that it happened .
they have readily recognised in him a great champion , facilitator and uniting their work , but noting that he was reluctant to produce himself .
this image was uncertain the monument " sites of memory " , in which he has attached his name , also contributed .
the nasty languages have been able to see a giant flea market , presented by an intelligent commentator with a keen eye and ballasted erudition , but hopelessly dilettante .
the two books published by nora nearly two years have already established that was not to write a lot and was well written .
the book that should make him definitively justice .
there is yet again , the temptation of ubiquity , the intellectual , promiscuous jubilation as step from one topic to another .
but it soon becomes apparent that the disparate objects assembled in this beautiful book under the dealer back to one and the same passion : discover the constituent node of the french identity .
why these dramatic calls for national unity ?
identity : it is a matter of time .
recently , we were collectively invited to give a definition .
but in the minds of our leaders peremptory , french identity was a timeless essence .
it had to deploy in accidents , and the matter requires jacobinism , was entrusted to prefects and sub-prefects , interpreters allowed .
that stalking pierre nora is quite different .
it is not an heir of an eternal french , he refuses to the definition .
worried an analyst familiar strangeness , he wandered in a forest of symbols , stopped at each step by an object in the form of a riddle , tormented of irritating questions .
including this one , which is the company itself : why , in a country so durably installed within its borders , if formerly constitution and solidly stonework , it is these dramatic calls for unity ?
they are so pressing , suggests pierre nora , to stave off the disorder born discord in french history .
francs and gauls , armagnacs and burgundian , catholics and protestants : the forces of division , here are very old .
and most emblematic is obviously that cleaves the two national history .
after the earthquake of the revolution , the french have two stories and they have two nations , the monarchy , the other a revolutionary .
the second sought to the death of the first , but did not reach the deny ; anxious instead of finding the sanctity and all the more eager of unity and indivisibility that it had cut the lead to that was the obvious and powerful incarnation .
and , from there , a nation invinciblement binary , shared between left and right , secularism and catholicism , adoration and hatred of the revolution .
to feel this singularity of french identity , nothing beats the four outside of france , so the american getaway of pierre nora could well be the heart of his book .
because america and france have both made a revolution , drafted a bill of rights , wanted to build a new society .
but the american view is that better highlight what we own .
there , men who had let their old regime in england and no longer had to worry about it .
here , men crowded indigenous old regime , and even more radical .
a consensual revolution here when she sowed the drama and the confit .
the founding fathers always honored , and here revolutionaries whose ancestors are hard to make models , and among the rest .
an institutional consistency , and here a cascade of constitutions , as errors to catch up and trials to resume .
france going , france comes
yet there was a time when the french thought they could mend the torn dress of their history , and overcome the curse of the figure .
at the third republic , central time and creator , pierre nora has shown great interest and even tenderness : welcoming those who are employed to repair the fracture , revolutionary teaching schoolchildren everything in the old france preparing obscurely modern france and offering them a unified version of their history .
but that identity has had a peaceful time .
here again in debate , shoved by a new type of immigration , threatened by the rise of industrial minorities , absorbed in the european area .
the book thus provides a fascinating portrait of france and the cautious sketch of france .
with the portrait of the historian , who should reserve a few surprises .
it says that the chemineau was a homely .
the man multiple curiosities revolved , slightly obsessive , around the same idea .
the prowler edges stood at the center of the center .
and anyone who had filed for more than a half-century , a topic on the idea of nation , but was removed from the exercise of the initiatic thesis , says , cum grano salis , that it will eventually do so .
admittedly in a gentler , more fragmented and more subtle form .
but let us make no mistake , equally binding .
because far more than the figure imposed the university curriculum , this thesis that the need for a domestic life .
how biometrics will invade our lives
passwords typing for accessing its smartphone or pay its purchases ?
american , french or japanese researchers we predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors phones and computers .
bernard didier , deputy director general of morpho , believes that even the century will be " biometric " .
only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person conducting transactions in such a universe and transverse transnational internet .
organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this craze for biometrics , but worry about it .
in 2011 alone , and in france , the commission nationale de l ' informatique et des libertés authorised 774 systems of fingerprint recognition , the shape of the hand or venule hand in businesses , administrations , canteens ...
" everyone can soon be identified , anywhere and anytime , " upset justin brookman , head of consumer privacy within the trc ( center for democracy and technology in washington .
the reasons for such optimism , among some , and pessimism among others ?
biometrics will rely on new techniques which will enable new services to citizens and consumers .
today , in france , the most used biometric data are fingerprints , the contour of the hand and venule palm and fingers .
but each of these techniques has its constraints .
" for example , some people who work the concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable , " says philippe robin , technical director of the identity of thales communications & security .
and the collection and verification of venule and contour of the hand involves a voluntary gesture and specific people .
it is both a security - you cannot capture these data without their knowledge - and a drawback : the procedure shall be repeated at times and therefore takes time .
a result , research is conducted over the past 20 years on other approaches , such as facial recognition or iris ( the coloured part of the eye ) .
thanks to the increase in the accuracy of the sensors and computational power of computers needed for the analysis of the data , these techniques become operational .
the accuracy of facial recognition has grown tenfold over the past five years , calculates cyrille bataller , director of r accenture laboratories in europe .
with our help , the united kingdom and the netherlands have deployed border crossings using automatic facial recognition .
it is now possible to identify a face or a moving iris .
" today , we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors , but we need a quiet environment , " said sridhar iyengar , director of security research at intel labs .
single and unfalsifiable , dna marker also raises hopes and concerns .
" in the current state of knowledge , it can be considered the ultimate biometric , " confirms sophie vulliet-tavernier , director of education , innovation and foresight to the cnil .
but dna analysis is still very long and very expensive .
nec offers the services of judicial police suitcase costing 90000 euros to analyze dna samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour .
the uses of biometrics are divided into two groups : the identification ( recognize a person among others ) and authentication ( ensure that the person is that it claims to be ) .
the identification was so far the issuance of identity papers : we must confront the biometrics ( fingerprints , iris photo ) with the information that the state has on all citizens already on file .
this ensures that a person does not try to impersonate someone else .
this principle of comparison may have other applications .
nec offers recognition of vip at the entrance of a hotel or a store .
" we ' re getting the images of surveillance cameras and compare them with photos of celebrities who move freely on the internet , " explains dany nassif , responsible for nec france , commercial development for the biometric identification solutions .
another use : take a photo quidam who is queuing up in a store , track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time .
authentication was initially the physical access ( protected borders , premises , canteens , etc . ) or logical ( opening a computer ) .
there is added , more recently , the control of presence .
" a biometric pointeuse avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend that points to another , " justifies cyrille bataller , accenture .
but , increasingly , authentication will also involve transactions , particularly those from devices connected to the internet .
in japan , it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing its card and hand over a biometric reader : this replaces the minting of the secret code .
a similar technique is tested in villeneuve-d ' ascq and angoulême by natural security in partnership with banks and signs of mass distribution : when pay in store with her bank card , the customer does not slap its code , but introduces his finger in a reader that scans the veins .
experimentation is planned to last six months .
if it is conclusive , biometric readers may soon arrive in french traders .
ways to reassure users
there are three ways to make biometrics attractive in the eyes of the general public .
the first is to explain that it can save time .
" if , through biometrics , a client remains in cash thirty seconds less , it is significant , " says the director of a large area .
the second is to offer personalized services : in a few years , a voice server can recognize your voice and offer tailored options .
and , finally , reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases .
" the fingerprints are stored on a server ; the identities of the people are in a second base : the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure housing , which freezes if it tries to move on , " lists philippe robin , thales .
but the lack of comprehensive studies , it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users .
the protection of privacy , continue to worry .
" the progress of the facial recognition , the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of available photos on facebook , flickr or picasa , makes me fear the worst : a widespread surveillance , " predicted andrew patrick , the office of the privacy protection in canada .

frontier said it would pay $ 25 if the fees were paid in advance and $ 100 if travellers paid only once at the gate .
the spokesman for frontier , kate o ' malley said that the $ 100 were planned to encourage travellers to pay in advance .
" we do not want to pay this price , " she explained .
the airlines started charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .
passengers who were trying to avoid these costs were as much as they could in hand baggage stowed in the overhead bins , and often there was more room in these compartments .
these fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board .
o ' malley said that these new charges will not be used to collect money .
it is about understanding the most loyal customers of frontier that it becomes increasingly difficult to find space in the overhead bins .
passengers who buy their ticket on the site of the airline will not have to pay .
for example , a passenger queuing at a gate frontier could carry a bag for free , whereas the next person in the tail may have to pay $ 100 for a similar bag .
o ' malley explained that the site and registration procedures of frontier are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of the existence of these fees before arriving at the door .
the cost of hand baggage of frontier will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
passengers often nag about baggage fees and other costs , but airlines love .
they believe that the baggage handling costs are important and that passengers who want the service should pay for it .
many people on wall street consider adding baggage fees as a sign that proves that the airlines are paying expensive enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
yet many of them have not affected at the expense of luggage .
spirit airlines inc. had applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago , and the low-cost allegiant has followed a little later .
the only other company imposing such fees is the hungarian airline wizz air , said the airlines consultant jay sorensen , who closely follows the costs extra .
he estimated in a report in december 2011 , that the cost of hand luggage spirit reported $ 50 million per year .
sorensen , a former part of midwest airlines , recently traveled on spirit and wondered what he would find at the gate when passengers would experience the baggage charges unusual imposed by the company .
" i had never seen a boarding procedure as fluid in my entire career , " he said .
i expected to see gnashing of teeth and a brawl breaking out at the door .
the plane was full , he added , " the passengers boarded at lightning speed . "
frontier is also like spirit and charges $ 2 for a coffee , tea , soda or juice .
frontier said that passengers who take a soda or fruit juices can carry the can not open with them , and those who take coffee can be resservis free .
she always distribute water free of charge .
us airways has briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but fell back seven months later after passengers complained , and while no other major airline had followed .
the decision of frontier to pay baggage fees when passengers do not buy their tickets directly with the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go on its site .
the airlines pay to online travel sellers such as orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
this has prompted airlines to encourage passengers to purchase directly from them instead of talking to an online travel agency .
however , frontier has gone further in this area .
in september , it has begun to offer only half of loyalty miles to customers who bought their ticket through an online travel agency .
on wednesday , it has reduced the bonus miles by 25 % on a trip .
thus , a frontier travel 1000 miles purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
it also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the site of frontier .
frontier has a loyal base in its home city of denver , but its activity is declining and it loses money .
revenues fell by 9 % and flight capacity has fallen by nearly 13 % in the first quarter , according to financial results published wednesday by its parent company , republic airways holdings inc .
republic has tried to put the finances of frontier by selling the airline .
scientists come to highlight how the movements of the tail of a dog are linked to his mood .
previous studies had shown that the dogs happy remuaient more their tail to the right ( the dog ) , while the nervous dogs the remuaient more towards the left .
but now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond .
professor giorgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the university of trento , said : " everyone knows that , in humans , the left and the right side of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimuli that are positive or negative emotions . "
here , we tried to see what it was in other species .
he added that as well as in humans , dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions .
to learn more about how dogs react to tail disorderly movements other dogs , the researchers followed animals watching films featuring other dogs .
they measured the frequency of heart animals and analyzed their behavior .
we must certainly not long before we understand why their tail will sometimes on one side and sometimes the other .
professor vallortigara explained : " we have presented to dogs films featuring other dogs – a naturalistic version is a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factors – and we were able to peddle the movement of the tail and present it as going to the left or right . "
when the animals have seen a dog expression without disturbing the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the dog wagging the tail ) , they remained perfectly relaxed .
but when they spotted a tail mainly shifted to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog wagging the tail ) , their heart rate has accelerated and they looked anxious .
professor vallortigara said he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate among themselves through these movements .
instead , he believes the dogs know the movements they should or should not worry .
he added : " if you have several times other dogs and if you notice that most of the time , the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude , you respond on the basis of this experience . "
the researchers suggest that the results could allow owners , veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals .
the canine behavior expert john bradshaw , visiting professor at the school of veterinary sciences at the university of bristol , said that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right for canines .
last year , a team from the university of lincoln discovered that dogs turning the head to the left when they watched an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyous dog .
and in another scientific study by the university of victoria in canada , he said : " the dogs would more easily into a robot dog when its tail was waging to the left rather than to the right , instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is contained in the italian study . "
he said that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs involved in the various studies did not entirely animals films or robots as dogs dogs .
a study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful , " he said .
" although many elements , among different mammals , indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception , " he said .
however , given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered , we must certainly not long before we understand why the tail moves sometimes on one side and sometimes the other .

obama puts an end to wiretaps for the imf and the world bank
barack obama has ordered the national security agency ( nsa ) to end that it was tapping on the international monetary fund and the world bank within the framework of its intelligence activities , a us official , on thursday .
this decision is part of the attempt by the white house to resume the hand in the case of the nsa 's eavesdropping after the revelations by the former analyst edward snowden , a refugee in russia .
this is the first time that the surveillance is mentioned the imf and the world bank by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal .
asked about the subject , an official of the us administration replied : " the us does not conduct electronic surveillance for the seats of the world bank and the imf in washington . "
speaking in anonymity , the official did not specify whether such surveillance was implemented in the past .
another official has indicated that barack obama had given orders to stop such practices in recent weeks .
this instruction was given at about the same time as ending the bugging of the headquarters of the un in new york .
in this context , the senate intelligence committee approved thursday a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but allowed them to continue .
the committee has introduced new restrictions on the data that the intelligence agencies are permitted to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the conservation of such information .
europe 's stock markets down in mid-session , except london
with the exception of london , the major european stock markets are down friday at mid-session , sealed by some new companies disappointing , while wall street is expected to rise .
moreover , investors remain cautious because they believe that the us federal reserve could break its policy of quantitative easing sooner than expected .
conversely , after the announcement of inflation to 0.7 % for the whole of the eurozone , the idea is spreading among market participants that the european central bank ( ecb ) could loosen its monetary policy .
the future of wall street suggests an opening for us stocks rising , after two consecutive sessions of decline .
the values , renault ( -4.63 % ) recorded the highest decline in the cac 40 , crippled by the warning on outcome of its partner nissan motor friday .
royal bank of scotland ( -6.26 % ) marks the worst performance of the eurofirst300 , having also published results down this morning and announced the creation of an internal structure hiving ( " bad bank " ) with 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets .
meanwhile , vodafone ( + 2.45 % ) remains at the top of the eurofirst300 increases in response to a press information that at is studying a possible bid .
on the foreign exchange market , speculation about the evolution of the monetary policy of the ecb are progressing , as shown by john hardy , strategist at saxo bank .
the unique mandate of the ecb has always focused on inflation , so mario draghi and his team have more reason to act at the meeting next week .
we anticipate a strong potential downside of the euro .
in this context , the euro continues its decline against the dollar and touched a session low of two weeks at 1.3517 dollars .
these same conjectures support unlike the bond market in the eurozone .
this judgment means that a law adopted in july in the state and largely questioning the right to abortion is going to come into force .

the congolese army chasing rebels of the m23
the congolese army ( fardc ) announced thursday that its units would chase the rebels of the m23 in their bases in the forests and mountains of north kivu bordering rwanda and uganda .
the m23 is about to be beaten after being chased out of the localities in the north-east of the democratic republic of congo ( drc ) he controlled from the beginning , there are 20 months of the insurgency .
" we will continue the m23 and cornering wherever it is hiding because they are criminals , " said reuters colonel olivier hamuli , spokesman of the fardc .
we must not let them reorganize because they martyrisent the congolese people for too long .
the time has come to bring peace .
officials from the m23 explained have evacuated localities under diplomatic pressure and bertrand bissimwa , political leader of the rebellion , said on rfi that these military setback does not alter its claims to peace talks .
the latter , according to the ugandan mediators resumed wednesday in kampala between the kinshasa government and the m23 .
skirmishes are reported in the hills that dominate bunagana , the last town in the hands of the insurgents to be dropped this week , as well as around runyoni , a hill where the m23 rebellion began in 2012 .
at their peak in november , the insurgents have occupied goma , the capital of north kivu province , taking advantage of the leak of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the monusco .
the fall of goma has led the united nations mission in the drc , the largest in the world in terms of staff , to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of south african , malawian and tanzanian soldiers .
for its part , the staff of the fardc has been redesigned and the army went on the offensive against the m23 , change the course of the war .
the pace of government troops today is unprecedented .
" the m23 appears to be coming to an end , " predicted an expert in congolese affairs , jason stearns , on his blog congo siasa .
this would be historic - it would be the first time that the government of kinshasa managed to beat a major insurgency .
and it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group ally in rwanda would be present in the east of the drc .
un experts accuse rwanda , which denies the fiercely , militarily supporting the m23 , initially set up former congolese military mutineers .
the head of british diplomacy , william hague , has invited president paul kagame of rwanda to exercise restraint , announced a spokesman for the foreign office .
last week , kigali had raised the possibility of military reprisals in the wake of the shells fell in rwandan territory .
on wednesday , the inhabitants of bunagana have invaded the streets of the village to welcome the entry of fardc soldiers .
" we lived a year with the m23 and it seemed unimaginable one day be released by the army , " reflects an inhabitant of this locality bordering uganda .
" we lived in terror ( m23 ) , we are traumatized , " said the man .
john kerry conceded , is without precedent , that the american espionage had gone too far " inappropriately "
john kerry has indicated a radoucissement the defensive attitude of the united states vis-à-vis its surveillance programs assuming unprecedented that on several occasions , espionage had gone too far " inappropriately . "
the secretary of state has also admitted that he had , like barack obama , ruled on " automatic pilot " when a series of incendiary revelations from whistleblower edward snowden about the espionage activities of the nsa has emerged .
the leaks have put the us government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
speaking at an intergovernmental conference in london via video link , mr kerry said : " it is undeniable that the president , myself and other members of the government have seen some things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity , from the second world war and to the difficult years of the cold war , and then , of course , 9 / 11 . "
he then became the first senior member of the united states government to admit that the american espionage had overstepped the mark , but insisted that rights were not violated .
he said : " in some cases , it has gone too far inappropriately . "
and the president is committed to try to clarify and make clear to people that it was now a thorough review of these practices so that nobody feels wrong .
i assure you that the innocent people will not be abused in this process .
mr kerry insisted , however , that the nsa was a force for good acting and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
he added : " we live in a new world where people are ready to blow . "
there is a radical extremism in the world who is determined to try to kill people , detonate and attack governments .
and if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act ?
we have actually prevented planes from falling buildings to explode and people to be murdered because we were able to see the facts in advance .
meanwhile , us lawmakers will travel to europe to meet concerns about the case of alleged american espionage and convince europeans of the need for further joint efforts to combat terrorism with the united states , said thursday the chairman of the senate subcommittee on european affairs .
senator chris murphy of connecticut said he spoke to members of the european parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of the anti-terrorist organizations because of the sense of frustration about the supervision of the national security agency .
" it is really important for the protection of national security in the united states that the europeans are still with us in the mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism , " said murphy , a democrat serving his first term , and chairman of the subcommittee on european affairs of the us senate , in an interview from washington .
and i am going to europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism , despite the anger provoked by the nsa programs .
the press reports that the nsa has captured millions of communications in europe , which has undermined relations with some allies of the united states , however , the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that nato allies had collected and shared with the united states .
other revelations reported documents disclosed by snowden that the nsa had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of german chancellor angela merkel and 34 other heads of state .
the intelligence chief , james clapper , has justified spying on allies by saying that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides .
in this atmosphere of tumult , murphy said that his office organized a trip to the congress , which should take place this year , and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers .
the names of the other participants legislators should be unveiled in the coming days .
he said that the route remained to be determined .
murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations , but also to show " tough love " .
he explained that the european heads of state had to be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs that they apply themselves for years .
" we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of europeans , but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to conduct espionage , " said murphy .
meanwhile , kerry has planned to travel this weekend in the middle east and poland to manage the resentment caused by the us strategies in syria , egypt and iran , as well as by the monitoring activities of the united states .

for the ceo of titan , " the proposed purchase of goodyear amiens starts with zero employee "
after having thrown in the towel , noisily in january for the partial resumption of site goodyear amiens-nord promised closure , maurice taylor , the ceo of the american pneumaticien titan , declares today , ready to save 333 jobs on 1137 in the factory .
arnaud montebourg , minister of productive recovery , had already announced , monday 21 october .
having abandoned the plan to purchase the plant in january , you come back today .
you had pronounced violent attacks and insults , speaking of " so-called workers " who work three hours a day , " " crazy " unions , the cgt .
we do not understand this volte-face .
is it to please mr montebourg ?
i was trying to please anyone .
except my wife .
mr montebourg , is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid .
if i hurt someone by my words , i am sorry .
but france has a high level of taxes and unemployment .
the truth is hurting you ?
working seven hours a day when other countries working eight hours underdevelops france .
in india , china and other countries , working 10 to 12 hours a day .
but i have no prejudices on france .
what i see , it is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires , has good facilities , is well located and has space to expand .
why titan has so much need this plant ?
titan did not need to buy the plant .
but , with the right price and skilled workers , it is worth trying .
what kind of agreement you between the cgt and goodyear ?
if , since the announcement of the closure of the factory , goodyear had offered employees a good severance package , i believe that 100 % of employees have accepted .
now , imagine that titan buys goodyear closed the plant .
therefore , titan could move the machines to poland or any other country of the european union , which still has its own currency .
i think that mr montebourg knows this .
however , he wants to keep the plant in amiens with at least 333 well paid jobs .
titan accepts to recruit among the approximately 1200 current employees of goodyear .
mr montebourg he need a commitment from titan before trying to bring the cgt to sit at the table with goodyear .
the first step is that the cgt and goodyear seal an agreement on severance benefits for all employees .
therefore , there will be more employees in the plant .
mr montebourg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs over four years .
the confirmation ?
the only number that i mentioned at the minister , it is 333 .
i know he would like a guarantee of four years .
but , as i said , the cgt and goodyear must first agree on severance .
if all employees accept the plan to purchase the plant starts with zero employee .
how can we give guarantees of employment tenure when there are no more employees on the site ?
if mr montebourg manages to what the cgt and goodyear agree and titan buys the factory , we intend to remain in amiens-nord over four years .

the supreme court validates the law to reform the health system of obama
great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court said today that the law of health system reform ratified by obama was constitutional .
by 5 votes to 4 , judges have validated the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act ( law on the protection of patients and care affordable ) – which requires that citizens buy health insurance by 2014 , under pain of paying a fine – and said that it was constitutional under the government 's power of taxation .
the president of the supreme court , john roberts , joined the four more liberal members of the court , while justices scalia , thomas , alito and kennedy disagreed .
the court has also validated the other sections of the law 's 2700 pages and has also considered that the provision of the law to reform the health system , which requires lowering the threshold for eligibility for medicaid or lose all federal funding of the program was coercive in accordance with the constitution .
the procedure to block the law was brought by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
all the major republican presidential candidates competing in the 2012 primary , including the nominee mitt romney , are fiercely opposed to the law .
aretha franklin resurfaces on stage in december
the detroit news newspaper reported that the queen of soul will occur on december 21 at the sound board room of the motorcity casino hotel .
ms. franklin is in november in the recording of an album for clive davis and sony music , produced by don was and kenny " babyface " edmonds .
without specifying the disease she was suffering , the famous interpreter of respect had said to the media on october 16 that the side effects of treatment she received were " difficult . "
she claims to be " happy to be back . "
we should teach the myths and legends to children as " models of lifestyle , " says the author .
the legend of thor could show that " brute force is no match for the subtle trick , " while the celtic legends revealed the importance of having a dream .
saying that many myths would be " too violent , too scandalous and in some cases , far too obscene to be taught in school , " crossley-holland advocated a " careful selection " of the works adapted to age .
" i think it is wonderful that in america , myths and folklore are already part of education , " he said .
i would argue in favour of this project for 20 years .
he added that the fact that the authors and teachers are " openly didactic " children " out , " the messages being " sublimed " in pleasant stories .
crossley-holland , who has translated beowulf of the anglo-saxon and wrote the penguin book of norse myths and british folk tales , said : " you may have good intentions , but you prefer to keep them out of sight . "
perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope .
not that everything has to be simplified or finish well , but there is an innate sense of right and wrong .
and it must be sublimated ; revealed through a story rather than said .
the basis of what is known and shows that it does not say .
green light from the us to the publicis-omnicom merger
publicis and omnicom said friday he had not received any objections from the us authorities to their merger , approximating the creation of the first advertising agency world .
the merger brings the second global agency , omnicom , and the third , publicis .

they say they have also received the necessary approvals in canada , india and turkey , after south africa and south korea .
the expiration of the period under the hsr in the united states and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the réalisationde operation .
" the merger is also subject to obtaining other regulatory approvals and the approval of shareholders of both groups , " it added .
new demand for collective action against the brothers sainte-croix
a new application of collective action was lodged against the brothers sainte-croix , concerning sexual assaults that took place this time in saint joseph 's oratory and several orphanages , colleges and schools .
the request is based on the testimony of the applicant , identified as " j. j. " , which would have been masturbé in the 1950s , first at notre-dame-des-neiges by his teacher brother submitted , then by his confessor , father bernard , saint joseph 's oratory , where he was an altar boy and where his father worked as a painter .
the first resort was only three institutions , and when it was announced the settlement , many people told us : " i was in such a place that i can subscribe ? " said lawyer alain arsenault , which defends the victims in the two applications .
the collective redress just filed makes to allow the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of st. croix .
at present , the appeal brings complaints of 25 people who say they have been assaulted by the brothers sainte-croix .
the alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal , since many of the targeted institutions have closed in the 1960s .
the appeal also emphasises that the congregation of st. croix and st. joseph 's oratory , which is a separate entity , " allowed sexual abuse are perpetrated against children , " they have had a " moral , religious and psychological constraint on the victims , " they " were aware of sexual abuse and have suffocated , " and that they have " knowingly and consciously chosen to ignore the problem . "
these accusations are based on , among other letters written by the brothers ' lawyer sainte-croix , me Émile perrin , in the 1990s , but also by research in the archives on this subject by brother wilson kennedy , a former holy cross brother who publicly denounced the abuse .
the collective redress must first pass the stage of admissibility in superior court .
once the admissibility accepted by the court , the second phase , the hearings on the merits .
in the case of first resort , the congregation of sainte-croix agreed to settle amicably before hearings are conducted on the substance .

the city appealed its conclusions and its corrective orders , including a decision to allocate a controller to help the police department to change its policy and training program .
the court of appeal heard arguments tuesday on the request for suspension .
the court of appeal stated that the judge should be divested of the dossier because it breached the code of conduct for judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias , in part because of a series of interviews to the media and public statements in which she publicly reacted to criticism of the court .
the judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people wrongly targeting black and hispanic men under their control and search .
it has appointed an external auditor to oversee the changes , including the reform policies , training and supervision , and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in the neighbourhoods where the greatest number of controls .
in august , new york city has agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police check .
the hearing of the appeal by the city should be held after march 14 , 2014 .
the tactics of control and the search has been criticized by many civil rights activists .
this system of control and search has existed for decades in some form , but the number of registered controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor michael bloomberg , reaching its highest level ever in 2011 with 684330 controls that were primarily black and hispanic men .
a judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all from minorities , and turned into collective action .
supporters advocating changes in the monitoring program and search of the nypd say they will end the unfair practices , enable police forces more effective and we trust , and will change the way police departments use the policy .
opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without cutting crime would be a waste of money and do not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been greatly reduced over the last decade .
the judge stressed that it did not put an end to the control and search practices , which are constitutional , but reformed how the nypd implements its controls .
the nsa revelations increase paranoia of enterprises with respect to the monitoring of state
a beautiful day in late august , a german police helicopter flew at low altitude the british consulate in frankfurt , the financial capital of germany .
on the orders of the federal office for the protection of the constitution ( bfv ) , the national intelligence agency , its mission was to photograph the roof of the american outpost , located within 5 km of the european central bank and the bundesbank .
the german media that the bfv hoped to identify the presence of antennas listening and that the operation has sparked an exchange between the united states and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , the director of us intelligence services , insisted again in september on the fact that the united states do not use their capabilities in foreign intelligence to steal trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of american companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits . "
but since edward snowden , the whistleblower turned consultant , has begun to unveil his inexhaustible treasure trove of information on the secrets of the supervision of the united states , european governments and business leaders do not know whether to believe the director on floor .
reports that the us national security agency has spied on the brazilian oil company petrobras and had access to data held by us service providers in the cloud storage , including google and yahoo , have more than ever generated paranoia of enterprises with respect to the supervision of state .
the revelation that the phone of german chancellor angela merkel had been hacked , perhaps even for a decade , was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
if the most powerful person in europe can be covered , then business leaders surely are also potential targets .
snowden made the transparent intensive collaboration between us intelligence and businesses .
i believe that it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest .
" germany must wake up , " says oliver grün , president of bitmi , which represents german smes in the it sector .
german companies believe that the us is also a significant risk that china when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , according to a survey published in july by the consultancy ey .
however , in all documents disclosed by mr snowden , there is no indication to date that the united states have sent trade secrets of foreign companies with us companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu does not have sufficient capacity computing and the internet and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence vis-à-vis the united states .
business leaders are skeptical about this .
a member of the german parliament said that we should create a german google .
i can only close the eyes and reopen slowly ...
" this is not the right way , " says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software company , sap .
if we wanted a european it industry strong , then we should not let her die 20 years ago .
everything is subsidized in germany , coal cars , from farmers .
everything but the it industry .
yet the scale and sophistication of american spy agencies exposed by snowden 's revelations were a shock to some companies who thought until then that china was the biggest risk in terms of monitoring .
a big change is happening in cloud computing because european leaders have recognized that data stored in the united states are governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey conducted by the cloud security alliance , a professional body , some 10 % of non-us members have abandoned their plans to use an american service provider of storage in the cloud after revelations about the american exploration program of prism data .
jim snabe , co-director of sap , said : " our customers today , we pose a question that they do not we were a year ago : where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this court ? "
many german leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew , namely that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs .
it is not surprising that there is economic espionage .
there has always been .
" it is a recurring topic for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion , " says kurt bock , ceo of producing the chemical company basf .
the americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial plan just as we wrote , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
business leaders are usually reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place , in case it would the advantage to an opponent .
large companies have long hammer the message that it is very unwise to recover a free usb stick at a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room .
ulrich hackenberg , a member of the board of automaker audi , declares that the collection of phones before board meetings , so that they can not be used as listening devices at a distance , is a common practice for years .
the bfv germany advises its leaders to consider using simple phones prepaid during their trips abroad because of the risk of damage to the integrity of smartphones .
the prepaid mobile phones are then discarded .
however , there are fears that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance .
in germany , many smes are world leaders in their particular niche .
" smes often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access , " warns the bfv in a report .
the us alert their own societies on the activities of economic espionage conducted by other countries .
the national intelligence estimate ( nie ) conducted in february by the united states , cited france , russia and israel , guilty in the second degree the piracy of economic information , behind china , according to the washington post .
a member of the board of directors of a german company reputation felt that when it comes to economic espionage , " the french are the worst . "
bernard squarcini , former director of the french domestic intelligence , the dcri , said in an interview this month : " the services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , are spying on their allies . "
a tax on foreign property owners to burst the bubble of london
the treasury has provisionally costed the extent of the tax on capital gains but is awaiting a final decision by mr osborne in the budget for 2012 , entered a stamp duty of 7 % for properties costing more than £ 2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to hold properties within the framework of a society rather than individually .
the stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of westminster and kensington & chelsea , and represents £ 708 million in the 2012 / 13 fiscal year , which exceeds the total amount of northern ireland , wales , scotland , north east , north west and yorkshire and the humber region .
mr cook said : " following the increase in the stamp duty on the high value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance legislation , it is very difficult to argue that the high value properties are under-imposed regardless of the effects of the system of residential tax obsolete . "
" but this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in london or the current owners reluctant to sell , " he added .
the prestige real estate – 5 to 10 % of higher prices in the housing market – in the prosperous south-west london , which stretches from fulham at wimbledon , has risen to a record 11.8 % over last year .
prices in central london have steady growth year on year to 5.6 % but were overshadowed by an " internal market " growing , south-west of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and eastern ( 6.5 % ) experiencing a recovery , according to savills .
the shutdown in the us has slowed the rise in the automobile market
the closure during 16 days of most federal administrations has weighed on the growth of car sales in the united states in october , show figures released friday by manufacturers , five of the six main with lower performance expectations .
the three major detroit automakers show double-digit growth compared with october 2012 but only general motors has done better than expected .
analysts expected an average of 15.4 million in annualized sales and adjusted for seasonal variations but the market stood at 15.3 million , according to estimates of adam jonas , an analyst at morgan stanley .
in a note to clients , he believes that this slight setback can be explained by " the government shutdown and its impact on the consumer sentiment during the first half of the month . "
nevertheless , gm reported an increase of almost 16 % of its sales last month in 226402 vehicles , against 211563 expected by consensus .
the four brands of the group saw their trade performance improve from october 2012 .
ford , which continues to enjoy the success of its pickups , saw its sales rise 14 % on a year to 191985 vehicles , while the consensus expected 194301 .
for its part , chrysler , controlled by fiat announced a 11 % increase in sales to 140083 vehicles , against 143536 expected .
toyota and nissan also have lower sales in consensus , despite increases in a year of 8.8 % and 14.2 % , respectively .
the new york stock exchange , gm earned $ 1.4 % to 16.35 gmt while ford ceded 1.1 % .

a study to multiply the benefits of rail project hs2 to scotland was launched by the british government .
the work done by hs2 ltd suggests that the high-speed services to scotland and northern england will start at the opening of phase 1 in 2026 .
the minister of transport baroness kramer said the project " would bring together the united kingdom . "
the scottish transport minister keith brown said he was " excited " to the idea of working with the british government on the project .
phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between london and the west midlands .
when phase 2 will be completed , the lines serve manchester and leeds .
in june , the government has revised upward the estimated cost of the construction of the high-speed link between london and the north of england , from 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion pounds .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , asked hs2 ltd to explore strengthening rail capacity and improving the length of journeys to the north of england and scotland .
this must include the possibility of journey times between glasgow and edinburgh for up to three hours .
baroness kramer said : " our objective for hs2 is a truly national network that will bring the united kingdom and its cities . "
we push the hs2 project because the benefits are enormous .
without him , we are facing a problem of capacity of our rail network .
but it is also to develop connectivity between the 18 major british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , so that they are better with hs2 .
the british secretary of state for scotland , alistair carmichael , added : " today 's announcement is good news for scotland . "
for the scottish government , keith brown has called mr carmichael to support " unequivocally " the inclusion of scotland in the hs2 network .
mr brown said : " the high-speed train has the potential to deliver significant economic benefits to scotland , but it also makes the economic weight of scotland in the overall project of high-speed rail network across britain .
" so we are thrilled to work in partnership with the british government to examine options to bring the network of high-speed train to scotland , creating a benefit for all and supplementing the glasgow-edinburgh line that the scottish government is already planning .
" i am eager to read the review with british ministers next year and we will decide then set of next steps . "
the un welcomes the new objectives in the fight against poverty
the united nations will start now to work on a new series of targets to replace the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , which had been put in place 12 years ago to fight poverty in the world .
the australian diplomats played a key role in highlighting the " objectives of sustainable development " to replace the mdgs , which will expire in 2015 , before the united nations summit on sustainable development which began the previous day in rio de janeiro .
they appeared in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including ms gillard , during the summit .
the un secretary general ban ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to " rise above national interests . "
" i am pleased that the member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set targets for universal sustainable development ( sdo ) , " he added .
these sdgs will build on the progress made in the context of the millennium development goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .
i will do its utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the member states to achieve our vision of the objectives of sustainable development based on the success of the mdgs .
parents of intersex children can choose " undetermined sex "
germany became the first european nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs .
the male or female neonates will no longer be awarded their rigidly at birth .
under the new law , parents will no longer be required to disclose the sex of their child , allowing them to enter a sex " indeterminate " or " unspecified " on his birth certificate .
the purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could take hasty decisions about surgery of sexual reassignment for their babies , and to combat discrimination against the intersex people .
according to the bbc , intersexed person would have said years later , " i am neither a man nor a woman . "
i will remain the patchwork that doctors have created scar face bruised .
it is estimated that one in 2000 children born each year , is not a boy or a girl .
they are intersex , intersex part of the 60 diseases diagnosed disorders of sexual development , a generic term for people with chromosome or gonads ( ovaries or testes atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs .
wallis simpson could be intersexed .
sexual identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the united states say that when sex cannot be determined , it is better to use the best available information to allocate and then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act , as appropriate .
dr. jack drescher , a psychiatrist in new york and an expert on issues of sexual identity , said that the new german law " appears to be a good idea . "
intersex children pose an ethical dilemma .
" some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical act , but this is not the case for most of the children , " he added .
it is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation , and see how the identity develops .
the science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise .
nobody can answer the question of why this occurs .
it is like the mystery surrounding homosexual people .
a report submitted to the european commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender persons , since their status is not related to gender but rather to their biological , which is not exclusively that of a man and a woman exclusively , but is usually both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other .
these characteristics can be manifested themselves in secondary sex characteristics ( such as the muscle mass , hairiness , chest and stature ) , the primary sexual traits ( such as the reproductive organs and sexual organs ) or structure of chromosomes and hormones .
the report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced the intersex and transgender people in employment , as well as the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice .
young boys of non-compliant have now camps specifically targeting them .
australia and nepal already allow adults to register male , female or " third sex " on their official documents .
in june , an australian of 52 years , norrie may-welby , became the first person in the world to have been recognized " neutral " after winning his appeal , which allows it to keep an " unspecified " sex life .
the german passports will have a third designation alongside m or f – x for intersex , according to the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still the subject of controversy , according to a report broadcast on france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of lawmakers in this catholic country fundamentally signed a petition for the " gender theory " is removed from school books .
the american catholic online site also objected to the german law , writing that " because the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one , it reverses two other pillars of civilization . "
in maryland , the mother of an infant also stated on baby zone that she would prefer that one sex is attributed to babies at birth .
" parenting is stressful enough without additional restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your child , " she said on the site for young parents .
children need stability and certainty .
historically , children born without male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites , after the name of the magnificent greek god who had a double sex .
and there is barely a decade , the medical community considered gender as a slate , we can erase and on which we can redesign .
but now , many people questioning the ethical basis of surgery , knowing that the sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong , not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when it grows up .
" in the middle of the 20th century , this was called a psychiatric emergency , " said drescher .
when these children were born , we did not call the psychiatrist , phoned the surgeon .
the dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by dr. john money of johns hopkins , who considered that the genus is malleable .
he coined the term " sexual identity " and argued that the social and environmental signals – how parents raising a child – interact with genes and hormones of a child to shape the order that he be identified as male or female .
but in a case of 1966 , known as the " john / joan , " his theories have given rise to controversy .
he advised parents of a boy whose penis had been cut during a botched circumcision to castrate him entirely , by removing the testicles , and raise a daughter .
" money has presented this as a case of successful transition , but this was not the case , " said drescher .
at the age of about 15 years , he became a boy and married a woman .
but at age 38 , he committed suicide .
drescher said that some doctors " always repeat this model . "
but in the 1990s , with the arrival of the internet , those who have survived these sex change operations say that " they are not satisfied with the outcome . "
this is the case of jim bruce , a 36-year-old writer from montana , who was born with xy males but ambiguous sexual organs .
doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris , or a small penis and were convinced that it could never have a " satisfactory " life as a man .
so shortly after its birth in 1976 , bruce has undergone surgery to remove the external body and testicles and raised as a girl .
he has been taking female hormones at the age of 12 years .
" i knew that i was not a girl , " he said on abcnews.com.
i was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at 18 , he suffered a vaginoplastie .
but depressed and realizing that something was wrong , he asked his medical file .
what he found was horrified .
i was sterilized at birth – and nobody i was never told .
bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development ( dds ) that prevented his body to produce enough testosterone to its sexual organs can develop .
after learning the truth , he became a man , following treatment with testosterone and is removing the breasts .
the surgery has made him sterile .
today , he champions the cause of others in an organization called interface project , which is trying to standardize the collection of intersex people .
but anne tamar-mattis , executive director of the nonprofit organization based in california advocates for informed choice , is concerned that the german law " invites labelling and stigma . "
" many activists worry that the german law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an " indeterminate " sex , " she said .
we fear that it encourages interventions .
we think it would be better to assign a male or female , and wait .
but we have not seen what the law would give , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that his organization supported the australian law " because it allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex . "
" adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind , " she added .
the german law granting sex at birth .
this is not a battle that young children should lead to this age .
when they grow up , they can make decisions about their own bodies .
but dr. arlene baratz , a radiologist specializing in mammograms in pittsburgh , whose daughter suffers from a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group , said that the german law " empower " parents and children .
the daughter of dr. baratz , katie , was born with male chromosomes , but suffers from a dds syndrome called complete androgen insensitivity .
due to the failure of its androgen receptors , katie has developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina , but no womb or ovaries .
now aged 29 , katie is married internal and child psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania .
although it is sterile , she hopes to have children through adoption or surrogacy .
" the law allows some latitude to parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions , " said baratz .
this leaves them time to do some tests and understand them , and a deadline before entering " male " or " female . "
thus , everything is going well – you can raise your child and love it .
you have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent .
you do not have to rush to surgery that is irreversible .
" this puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what it takes , " she said .
finally , the child will decide what sex he / she feels the most comfortable – and it is something great .
this allows the child to take the decision for himself .
an octogenarian welcomes children with a gun in muy for halloween

one of the residents of the neighborhood of muy visited by children has opened the door with his shotgun .

his weapon was seized .
the cry of despair of a voter for obama
i voted twice for president obama , believing in the possibility of a change
he says that obama has made laudable efforts thwarted by the republican party obstructionism
obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the obamacare site nor the drone attacks
the memory of the obama 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what might happen
nathaniel p. morris is a student in her second year of medicine in the faculty of medicine at harvard .
i am reading a book horribly sad these days .
it is a book , i thought , i would encourage during the bleakness of the 2 year of medicine and giving me hope .
it is called " the audacity to win " and it is the memories of the presidential campaign of barack obama in 2008 .
when i finished the minutes of my medical patients in the evening and that i lie , this book i remmène when policies inspired millions of people and the speeches were breathtaking .
the election ended with a landslide victory and presenters newspapers news took the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment .
my comrades wept with joy and my parents have retained all the newspapers that they have found .
a young visionary team progressed to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
during the transition period of obama before taking office in 2008 , he had 82 % .
and then i close the book .
the return to this is a difficult , it is like waking from a dream .
it is difficult to remember these days full of optimism , as distant memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
the change really happened in the years that followed the first time i voted .
it had nothing to do with what i had imagined .
i put to credit obama 's great achievements since the passage of the affordable care act affordable care ) until the departure from iraq of our army , through the end of the " neither seen nor known " and the killing of osama bin laden .
furthermore , i believe that the partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation in the field of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of guantánamo , among other things .
but after repeatedly defended the obama administration to deal with my peers and my colleagues , i can no longer provide explanations .
i am on the brink of political desperation .
the republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders , nor the foreign children innocent attacks by drones .
it cannot explain that the national security agency collects data on americans ' privacy , nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government 's misdeeds .
it cannot justify the killing of anwar al-awlaki , an american citizen without trial , or the evasion of public funding and the overspending authorized during presidential campaigns .
it cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the white house to silence the media are " more aggressive ... since the nixon administration . "
and , more recently , it cannot excuse the failure to devise a simple website for more than three years after the law on the affordable care act was ratified .
i do not know if that is what i expected .
if , at 18 , i was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it .
obviously , the election is not predictable , because the opposition party and political events that occur by chance , as the massacre of newton , influence our public conversation .
however , all the examples i have listed above appear to be largely the choice of the administration .
that is what bothers me the most .
i have voted for obama in 2012 , but not because i was enthralled by his candidacy .
mitt romney was confused and a little refined alternative that did not seem to determine its policies or its positions .
i felt that obama , elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections , would take the promises we heard for so long .
yet , while the index of favourable opinions plunged below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book .
it makes me wish the many promises that have soared .
this week , i read the part of the book that describes how obama has suffered huge losses to clinton in the pennsylvania primary .
at a meeting after the campaign , he told his team that they had to recover on the right track and remain loyal to their cause .
" i want us to recentrions on our talent , " he said .
we must remember who we are .
we are 5 years later , mr. president , and i do not agree with you .

rbs suspends two traders on the exchange market
royal bank of scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange market division , according to two sources close to the dossier , which shows once again that the global investigation by regulators into suspicions of market manipulation of currency is beginning to bear fruit .
some of the world 's largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , have confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in the investigations into the most important financial market in the world , where 5.3 trillion changes hands every day .
the two traders are the first employees of rbs to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulation of the libor interbank rate .
the bank , which has refused to comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month have received requests for information from regulators .
" the ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are cooperating fully with the fca and other regulators , " said a representative of the bank two weeks ago .
last month , sources close to the dossier said that rbs had sent records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a former trader , the british regulator , the financial conduct authority .
the trader , richard usher , left rbs in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as head of european cash trading for currencies in jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of european fx spot trading at citi , has been put on leave this week , while matt gardiner , senior currency trader at barclays and ubs , was suspended by standard chartered this week .
none of these traders has been the subject of any charge .
the record of mr usher included instant messages sent to and from bankers working for barclays and citigroup , said sources close to the dossier .
ubs said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the swiss regulator , finma , said it was investigating suspicions of manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of swiss banks .
in the world , at least six authorities – the european commission , finma , the authority of the swiss competition weko , the fca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – examine the allegations made about bankers who agreed to manipulate the rates on the foreign exchange market .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators , said sources close to the dossier .
banks picked instant messages and emails for years to find wrongdoing .
the news about these investigations shook traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of growth of trading units of investment banks in recent years , but has been challenged this year because of the low volatility of currencies which limits opportunities for speculators .
some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast foreign exchange market highly liquid , but the senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true .
a senior trader said that despite the high volume of foreign exchange transactions daily , the fragmentation of liquidity between the platforms of management of trade and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms " explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at little cost . "
the news came the same day that crédit suisse announced that it had fired a trader working in his office funds negotiated the london stock exchange this week after he caused a loss of $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators .
" we are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was brought under control , " said a representative of credit suisse .
a chinese newspaper that has launched an appeal " will be redrafted "
a chinese newspaper that has launched an appeal on the first page for the release of a journalist accused of libel will be redrafted , says a regulator of the press .
the new express , based in guangzhou issued a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist chen yongzhou .
but chen subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public corporation .
now , the new express will undergo a " complete overhaul , " said the regulator .
the order of " realignment " comes from the administration of guangdon for the press and publishing , radio , film and television .
a preliminary investigation showed that the new express , belonging to the yangcheng evening news , had published several articles on the erroneous listed company zoomlion between september 2012 and august 2013 .
" the new express editorial was disorganized , " said the regulator in a statement .
he indicated that he had decided to impose a sanction of an administrative nature to chen yongzhou withdrawing his press card . "
he also ordered the " yangcheng evening news group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of new express , and recommended that it is investigating those responsible in new express and immediately revises the management team of the newspaper . "
mr chen wrote several articles for the new express on financial irregularities alleged a manufacturer of construction equipment called zoomlion .
after his arrest , his newspaper published twice a front-page appeal for his release , writing that he supported his journalism .
but mr chen then emerged on a public television station where he admitted having published false stories for money .
" in this case , i have hurt zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to win public confidence , " he said to the public television network cctv .
i did it mainly because i was running after money and fame .
i realized my mistake .
following the apology from mr chen , new express published his apology on the front page , writing that he had not properly checked his articles .
several important suspects have recently made televised confessions .
experts say that people are routinely forced to make their confessions , despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate himself .
obama backtracked on its reform of the health system
under an avalanche of criticism , president obama was back on his promise without ambiguity and often repeated that " if you are satisfied with your health plan , you can keep it . "
after hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination of their providers , republicans criticized the president in recent days , accusing it of misleading the american people .
yesterday , barack obama has adjusted his promise of origin .
" the vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it , " he said in a speech in boston .
speaking of what he calls " a boom in the news " about the terminations , president obama encouraged americans who received the notice to seek a new insurance on the market .
most people will be able to get comprehensive health systems and better suited for the same price , even for even cheaper than expected .
" you will win , " he said .
the administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5 % of the population who get their insurance themselves were forced to change their regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the affordable care act .
" let me speak directly to these americans : you deserve better , " said kathleen sebelius in testimony before the committee on energy and commerce in washington .
ms sebelius , who oversees the implementation of the affordable care act , said that the launch of the online market had " failed miserably " .
" i am as frustrated and angry as anyone , " she added .
i look forward to regain your trust .
it is a kathleen sebelius exasperated who said that while she believed his microphone cut from an assistant sitting behind her at the session of the assembly yesterday following an exchange of views contentious with billy long , republican of missouri , to determine whether it should join the obamacare .
for more than three hours , billy long has continued to urge mrs sebelius why " the architect " of the affordable care act had not voluntarily waived the insurance sponsored by the government to endorse a regime via healthcare.gov , it now boasts millions of americans .
the tribute to folk of coen brothers
" inside llewyn davis " des frères coen , grand prix of the last cannes film festival , is a nostalgic and funny film about the greenwich village in 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there , before the arrival of bob dylan .
joel and ethan coen , whose filmography has been the subject of a retrospective at the cinémathèque française , had raided the palme d ' or at cannes in 1991 for barton fink .
if dylan or hire the trio peter , paul and mary , joel and ethan coen have placed on the rising star of american cinema , oscar isaac , 33 years , but also on the global pop star justin timberlake .
in this film , full of humor where music is a central character and the songs online , oscar isaac is a musician and folksinger accomplished , while timberlake , his friend in the film , leaves the pop to folk music with a contagious jubilation .
about carey mulligan , she left the rich trappings of daisy mulligan in " gatsby " magnificent for less glamorous clothes , a soft voice when she sings , but the expletive debited the machine gun when she speaks .
" inside llewyn davis " tells a week on the tribulations of a folksinger who fails to break through and get annoyed with the whole world .
he reluctantly accepts the cuff replacements in the studios .
without housing , he toured sofas of friends who want to even receive it .
an air of documentary
" its relationship with the success is tortured , that is what interested us : a mixture of bad luck , a guy who is not there at the right time , which is not a careerist but integrates with a self-destructive behavior , " said the press ethan coen , crowned with his brother joel oscar and cannes .
if llewyn davis has not existed , the two filmmakers folk fans have built their story on real personalities of the era as folk musician dave von ronk .
the idea was to show the moment before the advent of greenwich village , the neighborhood of new york to become " the epicenter of the folk music boom that would generate international stars " as the journalist elijah wald , a friend of van ronk .
the film then takes the style of documentary , the music label dusty invaded of unsold 33t inhabited by an old smile , secretary to the choice of music studios at the time and cafés where were the singers .
the magic of the coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character who crosses the film constantly : a beautiful red cat in crisp , makeshift companion of llewyn davis .
asked about the way he composed his character , the actor and singer justin timberlake had recalled " grew up in tennessee , surrounded by blues and country . "
" my first music lessons i received from my grandfather who taught me to play the guitar , " he added .
for justin timberlake , if the work is required to be considered " good " , " serendipity can also launch the career of someone , " and " increasingly today . "
as llewyn davis refusing any compromise on his music , the pop star says in a career , " the most important thing is not to be cornered by anything that can stop us to express ourselves . "
chevron , the second american oil company , reported friday a drop in its quarterly profit due to the decline of its refining margins , while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining receding from the objectives of the group .
its net profit in the third quarter decreased to 4.95 billion , or 2.57 per share , compared to 5.25 billion , or 2.69 dollars per share , a year earlier .
analysts surveyed by reuters based on average earnings per share of $ 2.71 .
the group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter , up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier .
the company is 2.65 million bpd for this year , with growth of 25 % of production expected by 2017 .
most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in australia .
because of the cost of these projects , the annual capital expenditure increased by seven billion dollars in two years and are expected to reach 36.7 billion in 2013 .
profits of production activities have decreased slightly in the third quarter , while profits from downstream activities ( including refining and chemical production ) fell by 45 % to $ 380 million .
this decline in refining margins affects the whole of the sector .
the main competitor of chevron , exxon mobil reported thursday a net profit decline despite the rise in its production of oil and gas .

nsa spying : the united states are " gone too far , " admits kerry
the united states sometimes went " too far " espionage , acknowledged the secretary of state john kerry , in the first admission of washington in the midst of controversy with europe on the massive collection of data by the national security agency ( nsa ) .
after ten days of scandal , revelations and denials between the united states and its european allies , it is the first time that a us government explicitly admits controversial practices in the nsa by the interception of communications and data in europe .
" in some cases , i admit , as did the president , some of these actions went too far and we will ensure that it does not happen again in the future , " john kerry said at a conference in london in which he participated since washington thursday october 31 via video link .
in his speech , broadcast in the presence of his british counterpart william hague , the head of american diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and collection of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention against possible attacks .
citing the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , attacks in madrid in march 2004 and london in july 2005 , john kerry has assured that the american authorities had foiled many attacks , thanks to the interception of communications and information gathering .
" we have actually prevented aircraft fall , explode buildings and that people are murdered , because we were able to be aware upstream of these projects , " argued the boss of american diplomacy .
and john kerry , said to the europeans , " i assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been deceived . "
but we are trying to gather information .
" and yes , in some cases , it has gone too far inappropriately , " admitted the secretary of state , who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in paris , london and rome .
he assured thursday evening that president obama was " committed to try to clarify and that it was conducting a review of these practices so that nobody feels deceived . "
but the controversy between americans and europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press .
according to the washington post , the nsa intercepted data of hundreds of millions of users of google and yahoo .
the newspaper , citing documents obtained from former nsa contractor edward snowden , says the program called muscular " and conducted with the nsa 's british counterpart , the gchq , allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by the giants of the internet .
if one of the documents , some 181 million items were collected during the single month of january - ranging from metadata on e-mails , text or audio or video .
these interceptions would take place outside the united states .
but yahoo and google have denied any link with these practices .
for ten days , several major newspapers in france , germany , spain or italy , revealed that the nsa would massively intercepted data and communications from us allies and their leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel .
facing the wrath of european states and while leaks in the american press claimed that the american president was not aware of such eavesdropping , barack obama has refused to speak about it , citing national security .
by contrast , the boss of the powerful nsa , general keith alexander , has denied that its intelligence agency has received tens of millions of communications of european citizens .
he even returned the ball to european intelligence services that would have seized these communications , before providing the nsa .
this would include " military operations " in countries where these nato allies would cooperate with the united states and it would absolutely not do europe , " said general alexander .
and the controversy spread friday to asia .
indonesia summoned australia 's ambassador , whose mission is accused of being used by the americans as part of a vast network of international espionage has also attracted the ire of china .
puberty : aging sooner
studies show that young african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than young white girls .
the physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemical substances are responsible
experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
the trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist specializing in family issues and child health .
a mother should worry if breasts and pubic hair of her daughter start to grow at 7 or 8 years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatrics held this week in orlando , florida , dr. paul kaplowitz , soil endocrinologist , explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young american women and represent a new standard .
" i spend a lot of time to reassure parents – in general , this does not indicate a rapid evolution to full puberty , " kaplowitz said .
the obvious signs of development , such as the budding breasts , hair under the arms and the pubic area and body odours , appear earlier in girls .
but there has been only a slight edge to the age of the first rules over the past four decades .
in the united states , the average age is 12 and a half years , when he was 12 years , three-quarters in 1970 .
" once the chest began to grow , it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear , " said kaplowitz , also the author of " early puberty in girls : the essential guide to coping with this common problem . "
the time is the more accurate test to find out how puberty will evolve .
there is a debate about what constitutes the real onset of puberty , but it is considered " early " when the chest is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8 years .
in most cases , development slows or stops – it is something that a pediatrician can monitor .
a more rapid evolution can justify tests by an endocrinologist to stave off serious problems like tumors and cysts .
there are treatments to delay menarche and prevent other consequences : a premature aging bones that can inhibit growth and a small size to adulthood .
recommendations for medicinal and hormonal treatment are based on the child 's age , the rate of development , the growth rate and emotional maturity .
the psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that " controlling puberty can mitigate some behavioural problems and feel for young girls to be different from the others . "
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young girls have their rules .
" they fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues , " kaplowitz said .
" it was a shock , " recalls a woman whose daughter has had its first rules for 10 years .
even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules , it was not prepared emotionally .
she returned to school frightened and upset to be the first among his friends .
there are many theories brought to the attention of the public about the causes of early puberty .
yet , there is no coherent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or the sexual messages in the media are responsible .
the boys , like girls reach puberty earlier .
kaplowitz says that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic .
he participated in a study on girls aged 6 to 9 years between the percentage of body fat at the onset of puberty .
other discoveries support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
in this country , the young african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than young white girls .
there are various explanations .
globally , the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic climate conditions , through genes .
another problem : although the boys have hair on the face and the younger pubic area , the trend towards a genuine early puberty is not as pronounced among girls .
other physicians participating in the conference of the paa stressed the complexity of the subject .
the appearance of acne and pubic hair is common , even in infants and toddlers .
" we must be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty , " said dr. lawrence silverman , a soil endocrinologist working at the hospital for children at goryeb morristown , new jersey .
parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child .
" this may mean having a conversation earlier than expected , " kaplowitz said .
if you stay calm , your child will react well in general .
girls with early puberty should be reassured that , even when it happens sooner than expected , the process is part of life .

a former hostage in lebanon : " the return is quite complicated to manage "
abducted in beirut on 8 march 1986 with three members of his team " antenne 2 " coming filming a demonstration of hezbollah , the journalist jean-louis normandin was released nearly 21 months later , on 27 november 1987 .
retired since 2008 , he participated in 2004 to the creation of the turkish hostages " hostages in the world , " he chairs for several years .
its main objective : to get the opportunity for the hostages to complain and to bring their hostage takers before the international criminal court .
held more than 1000 days , the four hostages of photo ( al-qaeda in the islamic maghreb ) daniel larribe , thierry dol , pierre legrand et marc féret were released tuesday .
after medical examinations at the military hospital of val-de-grâce wednesday afternoon , they have since reunited with their families .
and try gradually to resume their lives .
" the nouvel observateur " questioned jean-louis normandin , 62 , former grand reporter , retired since 2008 , president of the association " hostages in the world . "
from the evening of your release , you were on the plateau of 8pm " antenne 2 " .
what are your memories of your release ?
in particular , in beirut .
when i am released , i found in the trunk of a car where i meet - without him because he is black - roger auque .
he said " it is released , " but i am not sure , and i think that we can still be killed .
we are very excited , but also very tense .
it is the war , and those who drive we are also very tense .
they put us on the edge of a sidewalk .
there are syrian military .
it arrives on the site of the summerland hotel where the press is present .
the french lead us to the french embassy .
this is the time of the first phone calls to parents , family , friends , the press ...
i remember taking a bath for an hour .
and he had lunch in t-shirt at the french embassy .
i also remember a short night to talk with roger and marchiani .
the tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to the airport of larnaca in cyprus .
arrived there by helicopter , taking a private plane that brings us back to france via corfu and solenzara , where pasqua embarks .
how did your arrival on french soil ?
it lands at orly .
chirac , prime minister , is here .
it is a bit brutal .
there is an incredible stampede .
and a lot of media .
when i left there were three television channels .
i come back and there are full .
descending the stairs of the plane , the reunion with my son and my parents , my friends , it is extremely emotional .
between the airport and home , many motorcycles follow our car that roussin leads .
the bikers are doing underfur to make photos and follow me to my home where i have to do a little police to prevent certain to mount .
the media pressure is enormous .
it does not stop , we are well placed to know ...
but the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to comprehend .
it comes out of a hole and you are suddenly under the media spotlight .
it is a bit complicated , a little violent , quite complex to manage .
but it has been the hardest .
in the evening , i am at 8pm the next day i am on tv .
then begins a sort of readjusting to life , very slowly , for a month or two that are a bit like a holiday .
how have passed the medical examinations and debriefing dgse ?
i had the right to a first medical control in corsica .
the rest was done in the val-de-grâce days my return : radios , examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist .
this is not a session that does everything but we know we can count on him , if necessary , that it is not delivered to ourselves .
it is part of the procedure .
i also met the intelligence services .
they asked questions about the kidnappers .
it was logical .
i was not embarrassed .
how do you respond today to the release of four hostages of niger ?
i listen to what is said .
the debate on the ransom .
some things annoy me , others less so .
i am trying to distinguish between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as chairman of the association " hostages of the world " that allows me to put the distance , and seems much more interesting to discuss .
i wonder , for example , on the definition of resilience .
above all , i am fighting , with others , to recognition of the legal status of the hostage .
i think there is a problem of semantics .
it should be called the hostage-taking of hostage-taking " policy " - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice , to complain and to bring their hostage takers before the international criminal court .
today , once again , everyone is in compassion , emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
but who says that these hostages may also have access to justice ?
a court in the hague is made for that .
why do we say to the kidnappers ' you have violated the rules of war , such as those of all the geneva conventions , we will bring you to justice ? "
it seems to me yet based , legitimate , struck in the right direction .
this message is heard but not listened to , and i am offended .
that is my main battle .

royal bank of scotland will create an internal structure of hiving ( " bad bank " ) with 38 billion pounds ( 45 billion ) for the most risky assets , a measure intended to relax its relations with london and accelerate its reprivatisation .
the bank wants to reduce from 55 % to 70 % the proportion of dubious assets on its balance sheet in the next two years and hope to have cleaned it altogether within three years .
rbs also said that it would enter a provision for depreciation of additional bad debts of four to 4.5 billion pounds in the quarter , related to the establishment of the structure of cantonment .
rbs has also specified that this restructuring would relieve internal 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital , thereby strengthening its ability to lend .
the bank and london have stressed that the " bad bank " would draw a line under the past , the government has in particular been accused of interfering in the management of rbs .
" we can now move forward , we worry about the future and 90 % of the assets that are a really good bank and build a great bank for customers and for the united kingdom , " said the new ceo ross mcewan to the press .
george kerevan : the collapse of europe gives scots the choice
another day , another worrying history of independence .
this time , we are warned that an independent scotland would be required to join the european area of free movement for eu membership .
and now we hear stories of passport control at berwick and a border of barbed wire along hadrian 's wall .
while it is true that the newspaper of strathclyde indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of europe , it was not yet in the headlines ( and predictably ) .
nor has said that the eu member states spend much of their time to circumvent their formal rules whenever it suits them .
as scotland is not part of the schengen area for the moment , a continuous non-compliance would be a slight concession that brussels could offer in return for everything that it wants scots .
it is a story that is not one .
and if an ancient history that it is now fixed : i have heard for the first time the hoax saying " independence means passport control " there are more than 40 years .
yet , it was forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of a dusty old tale .
why an independent scotland should follow the instructions of europe , in fact ?
why share the yoke of london against brussels , especially now ?
here is the real news on europe : the great post-war plan to unify europe is definitely stalled .
with the euro crisis , project europe is officially dead .
across europe , parties that oppose the eu or campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
even in germany , the eurosceptic alternative for germany party , founded only this year and come from nowhere , attracted nearly five million votes in the federal election in september and released the liberal democratic party ( equivalent of our liberal democrats ) of the bundestag .
there has always been a national opposition to the proposed creation of a federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis marked a turning point .
the austerity imposed by berlin and the european central bank , coupled with the straitjacket on national economies through membership of the single currency , has led many to think that project europe has gone too far .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budgetary deficits – this was only true for greece .
the european system has rather places on its members of favourable exchange rates to german exporters – what the german politicians want to keep .
without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency , the countries of southern europe with a problem of intrinsic productivity vis-à-vis germany .
the only recourse is to make drastic cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by berlin .
beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems , there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in europe .
following the energy " green " policies imposed by brussels – which are a reason to subsidize the french and german companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer – european industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the united states .
it is a fatal drawback in terms of costs , as we have already seen in grangemouth .
all wage freezes in the world will not prevent the european petrochemical industry to be penalized by a shale gas cheap american .
consequently , the cause , particularly in france , one of the great leaders of the eu .
after the war , the french political elite has regarded the eu as a way to control germany and paris on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin has no need of paris as passport policy legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in europe , leaving the french economy undermined scramble .
the result : the far-right party of marine le pen , the national front anti-european , has just won a crucial by-election , leaving the socialists to power in the third place .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning for the british labour party who reminded him that he cannot assume that a split from the right will automatically left .
what is marine le pen with his new popularity among the white working-class french ?
she wants to use the european elections next year to create a single anti-currency and anti-european bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-european parties do well in these elections , which is very possible , such a bloc could monitor the european parliament for the first time .
that is what i think : very soon , the anti-european sentiment and anti-single currency in europe will unite and will eventually kill the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be up to something more like " a europe of nations ( sovereign ) " free preferred by general de gaulle .
germany and some of its satellites economies could keep the euro , but france and southern europe will regain their own currency .
i expect that the uk distancing to this project , and i hope he will be cuddling up to the united states .
however , the growing interest of washington to the pacific suggests that britain will be left out in the atlantic .
and scotland , in all this ?
we can decide to be a region of the small england ( essentially ) .
or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes to brush off berlin and brussels .
i believe that scotland could tolerate a freer european agreement provided that we bear our own currency .
cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a europe of nations not federal .
otherwise , we should emulate norway and retain our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is – and it should be noted – the anti-austerity political movement that has been most successful in europe , since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on his opposition to the proposed cutbacks ( and implemented ) by the chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , labour and the conservative / liberal democrat coalition that followed .
it would be ridiculous now for scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by berlin and brussels .

with all due respect to heads of state who had a relative indifference to terrestrial foods , " they are all greedy , " denounces gently bernard vaussion .
jacques chirac had " a slightly more developed appetite . "
but with nicolas sarkozy , who had removed the cheese plates were empty !
as for françois hollande , who restored the cheese , " he is someone who likes to eat " and " there is not much that he does not like . "
the current head of the state , which regained the lost pounds before the presidential campaign , has " no specific request for regime . "
bernard vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders , particularly at the state dinner at the elysée palace : it must be " between 200 and 250 people in about an hour . "
the night before is almost white .
these people would not understand that there are errors .
the now former head of the kitchens of the elysee palace , which has taken a drink tuesday night with his team , his family and friends , share with an aching heart " .françois hollande came to greet me . "
he said praise .
" his human side has emerged , " he says .
the head will be replaced by his deputy , guillaume gomez , 35 , who is from seventeen years in the Élysée palace .
a collision between two vehicles left four injured , early friday , on route 131 , lanaudière .
shortly before 4h , a motorist travelling northbound in saint-félix-de-valois , lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the other direction .

traffic returned to normal around 6am on friday .
the investigation into mayor rob ford was botched , supports a lawyer
after police confirmed that they have put their hands on a copy of the video showing rob ford smoking crack , mr. clayton ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation as " botched . "
ruby suggested me to the canadian press that the police had " ignored or downplayed " the evidence against the mayor .
on thursday , police arrested the friend and occasional driver rob ford , alexander lisi , 35 , and has been accused of extortion on the video .
alexander lisi , previously accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the mayor .
the police also claimed to have seen this man delivering parcels to rob ford , indicate new court documents .
ruby me called " inexplicable " the police never searched the vehicle of rob ford or his home , or bugged his telephone , arguing that the police chief bill blair has chosen knowingly not to act against the mayor .
under the law , the police , having witnessed suspicious transactions by hand , might well have intercepted the vehicle of rob ford , the mayor , stop and search - even without a warrant .
it could also require a search warrant snapshot , if deemed necessary .
the chief of police has not commented , but his spokesman mark pugash described what me ruby " obvious and desperate attempt " to impress upon the media in a case that is the way .
during a press conference thursday , blair said that there was nothing in the video , which could constitute " reasonable grounds " that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor .
a veteran of the armed wing of hamas was killed this evening and another injured by fire from an israeli tank in the gaza strip , it was learned from medical and security sources in gaza .

the german journalists invited to flee google and yahoo
the union of german journalists invited its members thursday to stop using the online services of google and yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of american and british intelligence .
" the german federation of journalists recommends journalists to avoid until further notice to use search engines and couriers of google and yahoo , " she said in a statement .
it considers " scandalous " information from the washington post , that the us national security agency ( nsa ) and the government communications headquarters ( gchq ) raised british masses of information in infiltrating the international networks that enable both firms to synchronize their servers .
" research carried out by journalists are also confidential details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them , " said michael konken , chairman of the union which claims 38000 members .
a maf narbonne evacuated thursday evening
thursday evening , the first sitting of a film was interrupted at mega pmf narbonne , as a precautionary measure , following stinging throat felt by spectators .
immediately , the head of the institution has made to evacuate the room and warned firefighters for a suspicious smell .
about 70 people emerged from the session .
people have been examined and a full recognition of the room gave nothing .
bad joke amid tear jet ?
or unintentional incident ?
the fact remains that the film played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers .
the room was ventilated and everything was in order .
the cinema was able to regain its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images .
only on screen .
a house explosion in gesves : a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
the grandmother would have lit a cigarette at a gas leak .
the explosion of a home in gesves , who made two serious injured friday morning , a grandmother of 52 years , and his grandson of 5 years , is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater , said friday night the substitute of the crown prosecutor .
the expert sent by the public prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental .
the grandmother has lit a cigarette when there was a leak and an accumulation of gas .
the threatening of the two victims is always engaged .
the grandmother was projected by the explosion and was badly burned .
the boy , who was staying with his grandfather and his companion , was at his side and was burned slightly more .
" the two victims were intubated and packaged on site before being taken to the chu de liège , helicopter , ambulance , " said mayor josé paulet , descended on the scene .
traumatized , the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion .
unharmed , he was able to join the ground floor by the stairs remained intact while the rear wall of the house was totally destroyed .
the grandfather and the tenant of the house next door , weakened by the explosion , were relocated by the president of the cpas .
firefighters in andenne and namur and police of arches intervened .
the civil protection crisnée has stabilised the two buildings .
a black box in your car ?
while the planners of the road network of the united states are struggling to find money to repair the decaying highway infrastructure , many see a solution in the form of a small black box that binds above the dashboard of your car .
the devices , which record all miles flown by a motorist and transmit the information to officials , are at the centre of a controversial attempt in washington and in government offices planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing of the major american roads .
the largely meaningless planning thrusts suddenly provoked a spirited debate and hectic alliances .
the libertarians have joined environmental groups to exert pressure so that the government uses the small boxes to keep track of the miles you browse , and possibly the road on which you drive , then use the information to write a draft tax bill .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil liberties union is also very concerned and expressed concern about the protection of privacy .
and while members of congress cannot agree on whether to continue , several states have not waited .
they are looking how , over the next decade , they can move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles flown .
thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes , sometimes equipped with a system of gps monitoring for an experimental jaunt .
it is really essential for our nation .
" it is not as if we had the choice , " said hasan ikhrata , executive director of the southern california association of governments , which provides that the state is beginning to register the miles flown by each california motorist by 2025 .
there will be change in the way we pay these taxes .
the technology is there to do so .
the pressure comes from the fact that the highway trust fund , financed with taxes that americans pay at the pump is dry financially .
the americans are not buying as much gasoline as before .
the cars can travel more miles with a gallon .
the federal tax itself , which is 18.4 cents per gallon , has not increased over the past 20 years .
politicians are reluctant to raise the tax , even 1 cent , while gasoline prices are high .
" the gasoline tax is simply not tenable , " said lee munnich , a specialist transport policies at the university of minnesota .
his state has recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a payment system in the mile .
" it turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term , " he said .
wonks call that user fees in mileage .
it is not surprising that the idea makes the urban liberals , since taxes could be used to change driving habits to reduce congestion and emissions , for example .
planners of california are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the ambitious state law on global warming .
but the representative bill shuster ( r-pa . ) , chairman of the transportation committee of the house of representatives , said he regarded as the most viable alternative to the long term .
supporters of the free market of the reason foundation also appreciate the idea of charging drivers to the mile .
" it is not simply a tax entering a huge black hole , " said adrian moore , vice president of policy at the reason foundation .
people pay more directly to the benefits that are provided .
the movement is also supported by two former us secretaries of transportation , in a report in 2011 , urged congress to move in the direction of the payment to the mile .
the us senate approved a pilot project of $ 90 million last year that would have covered about 10000 cars .
but the chair of the house killed the proposal , responding to concerns from lawmakers representing rural voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or in town .
several states and cities are nevertheless progress on their side .
the most determined is oregon , which has mobilized 5000 drivers to conduct the most important experience of the country .
these motorists soon pay the state fee milepost in lieu of taxes on gasoline .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
the new york city is considering one .
illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks .
the coalition and i-95 , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the us east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) is studying how it could implement the change .
the concept is not a universal success .
in nevada , where about 50 motorists volunteers have recently equipped their cars with a device , drivers were worried that the government can track their movements .
" concerns about big brother and these things are a big problem , " said alauddin khan , who heads the strategic performance management in the department of transport of nevada .
it is not something that people want .
from the beginning of the trial , the aclu of nevada warned on its website : " it would be relatively easy to convert these devices into locator devices . "
it is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to keep the recordings of the daily comings and goings of people .
nevada is one of the few states that are struggling now to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles travelled a car , but without knowing the place nor the exact hour .
if we can do it , " said khan , citizens will be more comfortable .
the search for this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up of california named true mileage .
originally , the company is not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states .
it sought to break into the emerging market of auto insurance , in which drivers pay according to their mileage .
but the devices it tested liked planners of major highways because they do not use gps and provide a limited amount of information , downloaded periodically by modem .
" people will be more inclined to do that if you do not record their speed and did not locate , " said ryan morrison , ceo of true mileage .
big mistakes were made in the pilot programs in some states .
there are ways far cheaper and less intrusive methods .
in oregon , planners are experimenting by offering motorists different choices .
they can choose a device with or without gps .
they can still choose not to have a device at all , choosing instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles flown by all residents of the state .
other states are hoping to sell the concept to wary citizens by allowing devices to do more , rather than not enough .
in the city of new york , transport officials are seeking to develop a system of taxation which would also be equipped to pay parking fees , provide insurance payment to the " conduct " and create a set of data on the speed in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams .
" motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them , " said a document on urban planning .
however , some transportation planners wonder whether the whole debate on the payment to the mile is not simply a huge diversion .
the metropolitan transportation commission in the area of the san francisco bay , officials say that congress could simply manage the bankruptcy of the highway trust fund by increasing taxes on gasoline .
a single or additional annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline , so that everyone pays their fair share .
" it is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when it was simply need aspirin , " said randy rentschler , director of legislation and public affairs with the committee .
if you do that , hundreds of millions of motorists would be concerned for the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things .
the british police issued a warrant for extradition against assange
the british police have now issued a warrant for extradition against the wikileaks founder julian assange , who fled to the embassy of ecuador in london and has requested political asylum .
scotland yard said it had issued a " notice of surrender " against the australian of 40 years , asking him to come to a police station , adding that if he did not , it would be likely to be arrested .
assange could be extradited to sweden with allegations of sexual crime , after exhausting all possible avenues under british law after the supreme court overturned the appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month .
fearing that stockholm allows his transfer to the united states , he found refuge in the embassy of ecuador in london on june 19 , asking the country to south america political asylum .
scotland yard has issued a " remittance advice against a 40-year-old man who asked him to attend a police station , on the date and time of his choice , " said a spokesman .
it continues to violate the conditions of his bail .
the embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police .
assange fears he will be extradited from sweden to the united states where he could be accused of spying , having unveiled more than 250000 us diplomatic cables on the wikileaks site fighting the secret information .
letta confident in the longevity of his government
the president of the italian council enrico letta finds that his government will hold until 2015 despite high tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition ahead of the senate vote to strip berlusconi of his mandate .
in an interview with the daily la stampa , the center-left leader said he " firmly intended " to continue to govern with his coalition until the next general election in 2015 .
the upper house of the italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the council condemned for tax fraud in august .
silvio berlusconi threatens to withdraw its support for the government if the senate , where he has more opponents than supporters , utters his impeachment .
but some of his camp , centred around the national secretary of the people of freedom ( pdl ) angelino alfano , continues to support the government , as demonstrated last october 2 his refusal to bow to the demands of berlusconi who already wanted to topple the cabinet .
for more than a year , everywhere , i am able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people i meet : monstrous reassessment of their properties , deluge of taxes , cost of all kinds , administrative costs more .
in short , siphoning without limit in our pockets .
millions of wasted dollars could be saved in order to allow a much respectful of those who pay tax .
any money forcibly abducted taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment .
in shawinigan , despite the closure of all the major companies , he is not shy about the extravagant spending and maintenance of lame ducks : deficit , strong cultural centre grant at the cité de l ' Énergie , etc .
if these facilities are not profitable , sold to private enterprise or demolish .
it is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that never came .
but i give honourable mention to the transformation of the old wabasso in a kind of industrial incubator , but at what cost to the taxpayers ?
it is not the public levels to invest in such businesses , but the private sector based on consumer demand .
citizens have been pleased to learn that the fisheries and piles lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water .
following the departure of all industries ( water ) and the general decline of the population , water use has declined significantly throughout the territory .
without wanting to say of the waste , the city never forgets to water and the severe regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened .
in summary , it is easy to achieve great things with the money of others .
i would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet .
with a gross debt of more than $ 200 million , this city is no longer able to buy a pen without a settlement of borrowing .
we are managed for more than 40 years by cravatés with beautiful diplomas for most , and i do not believe that a sheep farmer is worse .
a worker dies buried under concrete blocks
a construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks , before thursday afternoon in montreal .
the tragedy occurred around 11.00 a.m. , on the street , marquette near the intersection of the beaubien street , in the borough of rosemont – la petite-patrie .
in all likelihood , work on the foundations conducted in that area for some time .
a wall of adjoining foundation had been erected in recent days .
the accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to recover its tools .
i spent in the car and i saw the wall crumble with a big cloud of smoke , said sylvain jean , which remains near the site .
i landed and i went to remove large bricks that covered .
there was only a part of his back , it is so unfortunate .
according to the authorities , the victim is an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a company of formwork .
the resuscitation manoeuvres have been tempted by the emergency services , but without success .
the man did not survive her severe injuries .
an inspector from the commission of health and safety at work has been dispatched to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy .
the nsa involves an " internal error " and not hackers for the outage of its site
the national security agency working in the shadows said friday that it was a bug that had caused the outage of its public site for a few hours , not hackers as some had claimed online .
" nsa.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during an update planned , " said the spy agency in a statement by email .
the problem will be resolved this evening .
the allegations that the outage was due to a distributed denial of service [ dsd ] are false .
earlier this evening , the servers online trackers noted that the nsa site had been down for at least 6 hours , and some users still cannot access the site .
earlier , a spokesman for the nsa told abc news that the internal network of the agency was " not at all compromise .
no classified information is in danger , explained the spokesman .
at least one group of hacktivistes online has claimed responsibility for the failure of the nsa site by a dsd attack .
the dsd attacks designed to flood a target site until the servers are overloaded and that the site collapses .
cyber-tactics is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to enter the internal network systemwide .
once the ultra-secret nsa , nicknamed " no such agency " has been under the spotlight and heavily criticised in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs nationally and abroad – which are part of the secret nsa files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the disillusioned former nsa contractor edward snowden .
the growing controversy over the agency has triggered much speculation that the incident this evening was the result of a cyber operation targeted .
the delta centre-ville now closed
the delta centre-ville hotel closed its doors thursday in montreal , after 36 years of existence .
the investment funds who owned the building was sold to developers who will transform it into student residences .
three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel .
of these , 200 have still not found a new job .
delta promises not to let its employees .
employers came to meet directly , it met individually with employees to assess their needs .
" this support will continue for the next six months , " says the director of regional labour relations of delta hotels , félix bisson .
the closure of the delta operates in a highly competitive hotel market .
the investment fund that owns this building had choices to make .
is it réinvestissait in the building to continue to operate , so there was the investment of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce , there are many new hotels that have emerged in montreal .
" or is it sold to someone else and that is what happened , " says paul arsenault , chair of transat tourism at the École des sciences de la gestion de l ' uqam .
other hotels in montreal will also be converted in the coming months , as the crown plaza that will become a residence for the elderly .
meanwhile , four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms emerge within two years .
you crave a neon ice ?
a british entrepreneur has created the world 's largest ice cream made from fluorescent jellyfish .
charlie francis has taken advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack .
he had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced chinese scientists to recreate chemically the brilliant protein .
ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the ph of the protein to make it sparkle .
chris explained that , since the cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth , the more you licks , shinier it becomes .
charlie , the founder of the company " lick ice me i am delicious , " said : " it is something amazing , but we are still in the early days in terms of production , and 2 g of this thing costs about £ 200 . "
the protein that we use in ice reacts with the language at neutral ph .
so when your mouth warms the protein , ph level rises and the ice starts to shine .
we have tested in recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all when halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice that i created because the jellyfish luminescence worth four times more expensive than gold .
every ball i therefore costs about £ 140 .
but she is rather good taste !
the company 's experimental approach of charlie , based in bristol , is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .
but his next creation looks even more ambitious .
he added : " i would really like to develop an invisible ice . "
it is inherently impossible due to refraction caused by ice crystals that form ice cream , but i think i will find a way to get there .
the ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish synthesized by chinese scientists .
one seriously injured in an accident with a ghost driver on the brussels ring
a road accident was a serious wounded friday morning around 5 : 30.00 a.m. , on the inner ring of brussels hoeilaart height , in the direction of waterloo .
the car of a driver was struck by a ghost driver , unscathed .
the ring has been closed to traffic until 9.00 a.m. , at the place of the accident , the time that the road is cleared and that an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
this situation has nonetheless caused little traffic jams because the accident occurred at the exit hoeilaart .
the movement could therefore be deflected by this exit / entry of the ring .
a child seriously wounded in a disneyland attraction in paris
a five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident on a disneyland attraction in paris .

at the time of the collapse , the boy was with his father on a boat in the " pirates of the caribbean attraction . "
it was closed until further notice .
snowden is ready to " cooperate " with germany on the issue of us surveillance
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us intelligence services , said he was prepared to go to berlin to testify before the german parliament if the national security agency of the united states and its director keith alexander did not provide answers about their activities .
the german mep hans-christian ströbele thursday met mr snowden in russia , where he has the right to asylum , to discuss his testimony in germany .
in a letter that was presented to the media in berlin on friday , mr snowden said : " although the result of my efforts was clearly positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself . "
however , the truth is not a crime .
in his letter , mr snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the us government to drop the criminal charges against him .
in the context of the complaint filed by the us department of justice , he is accused of espionage and theft of government property .
hans-peter friedrich , interior minister , told the german zeit online : " if mr. snowden is ready to talk to german officials , we will make this possible . "
relations between the united states and germany have been strained following complaints that the nsa had bugged the mobile phone of german chancellor angela merkel .
thomas oppermann , the mp who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services , said that if there was a chance to hear mr snowden as a witness " without endangering and completely ruin relations with the united states , " he had to take advantage of it .
mr. ströbele , german green mep , has published a photo of him with mr. snowden on his twitter account .
during his visit in russia , he was accompanied by two german journalists .
mr. ströbele said that , according to the lawyer of former nsa , mr snowden could not return to russia if it left the country .
if mr snowden testified in germany , it should be given the assurance that it would be " safe " there , " said mp .
mr snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a campaign of persecution " serious and sustained " that had forced him to leave his country .
however , he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to " my act of political expression . "
the citizens of the world , as well as senior officials – including the united states – have ruled that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility .
the letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the german authorities " when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved . "
a team of biologists led by the wildlife conservation society in new york has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the coast of northern australia .
thibaut bouveroux , responsible for scientific mission to the centre for conservation and animal science association and marins environments ( oceamm ) for l ' express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin you surprised ?
this is good news , but it does not surprise me particularly .
if in the past , the species have been described and identified on morphological , anatomical and geographic base , today , the development of new tools such as genetics , we can improve our science knowledge of the classification of species .
it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or membership of a species within the genus , family , or even an order .
at the beginning of the 19th century , morphological ranked animals , on the basis of morphological differences between the species .
today , some of these rankings are challenged because of advances in genetics .
similarly , two very close morphologically species were distinguished by genetics .
this is the case of the new species has been identified .
there is a dozen years , the scientific community recognized two species in the subfamily : the humpback dolphin pacific and humpback whales in the atlantic .
recent analysis has identified four species .
why is this an important discovery as the wildlife conservation society said ?
from a conservation perspective , it is essential to know these genetic differences , in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability .
if this population was already known for a long time by researchers , they did not know that it was part of a new species , only present there .
therefore , if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region , we could be dealing with the extinction of a species , rather than a local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on earth .
this loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
a species is considered threatened or endangered by the number of existing individuals on earth , that is to say the stock , and the possibility that she has to recover from the neighbouring stocks .
with regard to the species sousa chinensis , whose population of the new species is discovered , its stock is automatically become smaller , making it more vulnerable .
why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals ?
marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain .
they live in homogeneous , open habitats , in which there are many genetic exchange between populations and individuals .
the mixing of genes limits the creation of new species .
conversely , the more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation , which can lead to the creation of new species .
it should be noted that the marine environment is the least well known .
it prefers to send robots to mars , to know what lives in the mariana trench , just 11 miles from the surface of the sea .
more money is spent in the search for life on other planets in marine research and it is high time for change .
clive palmer claims that mp tony abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave .
the billionaire mp clive palmer argues that prime minister tony abbott has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system .
the mining magnate , who is contesting the payment of a carbon tax in an amount of $ 6 million , argued that argument to try to fend off questions about a possible conflict .
the palmer united party could control up to four votes in the senate , which could be crucial in deciding whether the carbon and mining taxes must be removed .
but mr palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that mr abbott 's daughters were ready to personally benefit from these policies .
" it will be a major conflict of interest when it comes to pay parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant , it will have a direct interest in the fact that it obtain or not leave , " mr palmer said .
two months after his election , the electoral commission officially declared that mr palmer won the sunshine coast seat of fairfax by 53 votes after a recount .
mr palmer has put forward the idea of an overhaul of the system of body votes to speed up the process .
girls of tony abbott , frances and bridget .
this election should be decided two months after the vote is over ?
" we need a better system , " he said .
why could we not have a system in which you can enter , seize your details into a computer , vote immediately and the result at 6 : 30 the next morning ?
mr palmer also criticised the use of pens to mark paper ballots .
is it to be able to erase the result if someone does not agree ?
today , have a pencil seems extraordinary .
the electoral commission has explored possible options regarding electronic voting and recently published a discussion paper with new zealand .
mr palmer , 59 , said that his political project included an international airport for the sunshine coast and that he would take his new position " very seriously " .
the exercise of public functions is a question of public service .
" we do not seek reward , except the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time , " he added .
when many experts in equestrian events met in cardiff to compete for and win the trophy for the horse of the year , they knew that the competition would be fierce .
but nobody expected to see win fenton kirkland , a child of three years .
not yet in school and only a few months after his first , the toddler and his shetland pony toffee have been during the three rounds with great ease and won the top prize , leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors .
the two inseparable – which are the same size – have been hailed for the presentation , the attitude and style at the annual competition held at the riding centre sunnybank , rudry near cardiff .
running against men and women in elegant bowler hats , he wore his cap a little flat on the side of laidback manner to scroll through his toffee 2-year-old pony around the track .
fenton was praised by judges for its natural qualities of dressage uncommon for a child of his age .
and toffee received high marks for his presentation and his personality .
fenton had toffee as a gift for his third anniversary in march and has since led with his shetland pony every day .
his mother donna , 30 , said : " fenton and toffee are an excellent duet . "
they went against all but the two have raided gold cup and the rosette .
it was only the second time he heightened with toffee and we were thrilled that he has won .
on the runway , people who knew him thought it was so dramatic that they wanted to be photographed with him .
the boy , from the village of nantyglo , near ebbw vale , south wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt sharon howells , who participates in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years .
mrs howells said : " there was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded . "
he walked the entire length of the runway and although he seemed to be very small , he has done a wonderful job .
fenton is crazy animals – he loves horses , tractors and the rural world and two chickens .
how it started , it will surely soon to the manifestation of the horse of the year – and i am sure he will make a good performance .
a spokesman for the annual equestrian event said : " fenton was only 3 years , but he knows how to lead his pony . "
they are a good team .
the judges noted that fenton and toffee were and how they marched on the runway .
they are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – fenton and toffee were the best on the runway .
i am sure that his clothes helped fenton , he was really terrific .
the minister of defence , rob nicholson , insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the canadian armed forces , and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life .
attacked by the liberals and new democrats in the house of commons , mr nicholson has ensured that before their release , members of the military followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors .
all wounded soldiers receive the appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before being ready , " he said .
critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing wounded soldiers - which do not meet the " universality of service " of the army demanding that staff are able to carry out a series of varied tasks - to achieve the qualifying period of 10 years required for retirement benefits .
in particular , they cited two cases reported by the canadian press , including a soldier released last friday .
cpl. david hawkins , a reservist from london , ontario , reached the post-traumatic stress syndrome , has been released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed pension .
his case came after that of corporal glen kirkland , who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed towards the exit before being ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service .
mr hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave , with the plans and consultation sessions , but that it was totally different that leaving the ranks .
" i told them that i was not ready , " he said in an interview with the canadian press on wednesday .
i asked for months if there was a way for me to stay , and they said no .
since the beginning of major fighting in afghanistan , the army is struggling to determine how it can grant latitude to injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks , but who are not fit to fight .
under current rules , the injured soldiers have up to three years to recover .
if they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad , they may be forced to leave the army .
data presented last year in parliament show that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons , 199 had not reached the length of service required for pension benefits .
the liberal critic veterans , jim karygiannis , asked wednesday the reintegration of corporal hawkins , while the ndp jack harris called for the immediate end of " this shameful practice . "
air raid against military installations in syria
according to the lebanese army , israeli planes entered lebanese airspace on wednesday in early afternoon , but the strikes have occurred in the evening .
a shipment of ground-to-air missiles short-range sa-8 would have been targeted and destroyed .
the new aviation raid of the idf in syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the israeli daily haaretz ) has not been confirmed by either israel or syria .
the raid took place in circumstances virtually identical to that which took place on 5 july : at the time , it is also a responsible american anonymous confirmed to cnn an israeli attack , this time the sea yakhont missiles , delivered by russia in damascus .
israeli officials have not hidden their irritation to see washington reveal the attack , threatens to force president assad to respond .
life in prison for a former chinese vice-governor
a former deputy governor of jilin province in northeast china , was sentenced friday to life in prison for corruption .
excluded from the communist party in july 2012 , tian xueren was accused of having affected more than 19 million yuan in bribes , the official chinese media .
between 1995 and 2001 , the deputy governor , who was also the president of the bank of jilin , a public institution , helped businesses and officials to obtain contracts , loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts , said the first intermediate court in beijing on his microblog .
president xi jinping , who took office last march , has made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the communist party .
if the head of state promised that justice would be so inflexible with the powerful " tigers " as " flies " - the junior officials - only a handful of senior officials have been convicted , including former executives of the oil giant petrochina .
the most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the pcc in chongqing , bo xilai , sentenced to life in september for corruption and abuse of power after he referred to the highest office in the state .
but the government has no intention of reforming the system to combat corruption by creating an independent body of the party .
the benefit of bombardier in decline , while shipments and aircraft orders are shrinking
bombardier inc , canadian aerospace and rail manufacturer , reported a fall of 15 % of its net profit thursday , under pressure from a decline in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its division trains .
bombardier , based in montreal , has not provided flight test data for its new cseries aircraft nor information on whether the plane will meet its ambitious timetable commercial service before next september .
after the inaugural flight test plane about a month and a half , it was stolen three times , and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track .
the results have not lived up to forecasts and stock prices fell by 8 % on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , an analyst at national bank financial , lowered its rating thursday from " outperformance " to " performance " because of the low potential growth in the stock market over the next quarter or the next two quarters .
" although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the transport division , " said cameron doerksen in a note to clients .
we believe that bombardier will record new orders for its cseries aircraft as the flight test programme progresses .
however , if no new order is announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program .
bombardier hopes that the family of cseries aircraft will catapult in the lower segment of a market now dominated by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was unveiled in march and flew for the first time in september after months of delay .
but the number of firm orders for the cseries aircraft is modest so far to $ 177 . it seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the assertions of society regarding energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner .
currently , the company recorded a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators .
pierre beaudoin , president and ceo , is convinced that bombardier will reach its goal of 300 firm orders before the commissioning of the first commercial plane .
leaders also reassured analysts and the media thursday that the program progressed according to schedule .
" the test is not stayed on the ground longer than expected , " mr. beaudoin told a telephone conference , adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the downtime of the plane .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we had decided to proceed with a first flight with a period of updated , and that is what we have done .
it will be repeated throughout the flight programme .
the second of the five test aircraft should fly in the coming weeks , others will follow shortly after , said the company .
however , analysts are sceptical about the fact that the first client to fly a plane cseries only 12 months after its maiden flight .
bombardier said that it was assessing the timing of entry into service and provide new information in the coming months .
" this slow flight tests – although it is apparently in line with the internal timetable of bombardier – reinforces our view that the entry into service will be extended in the first quarter of 2015 , " said mr. doerksen .
in the third quarter ended september 30 , the net benefit of bombardier fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share , compared to $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share , a year earlier .
eps adjusted remained unchanged at 9 cents .
revenue fell slightly to 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .
analysts were expecting an outcome of 10 cents per share and revenue of $ 4.56 billion , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s.
the fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world has indicated that he had delivered 45 planes during the quarter , up from 57 a year earlier .
net orders fell to 26 planes , against 83 before .
the delay in the aerospace division accounted for 32.9 billion to $ 30 , a figure unchanged from september to december 31 of the previous year .
" in aerospace , the results were in line with our forecasts , but the low number of orders and general market conditions have been disappointing , " said mr. beaudoin .
the incomes of aeronautics dropped 13 % to reach $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the world 's largest rail builder , said that revenue from this division had increased by nearly 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .
the backlog of transportation division totaled 32.6 billion at 30 september , a slight increase compared to december 31 of the previous year .
the margins of the transport division suffered problems on a few big contracts .
the leaders announced that new evidence would be provided in the fourth quarter .
the share prices of bombardier , which also announced that patrick pichette , chief financial officer of google inc , sit on the board , has fallen by 8.5 % to 4.83 canadian dollars in the afternoon on thursday .
the brazilian company embraer sa , a third aircraft manufacturer in the world and the nearest competitor bombardier , said thursday a 10 % drop in its quarterly profit .
the kenyan press is unworthy of the controversial media law
" it is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the question : what will prevent parliament to sweep the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? , " said the newspaper questioning the bill and asking what it is unconstitutional .
" this law is draconian and punitive , and we reject it , " said cyrus kamau , ceo of capital group – owner of capitalfm , one of the radio stations and internet sites of the most respected independent news in kenya .
he said that the new media tribunal " will always be biased because it is an extension of the government " and that restrictions on the content and advertising would affect kenya 's place in the global economy .
" i hope the president will listen to us , and we are asking him to reject this bill and send the parliamentarians , " he added .
according to the newspaper the star , the new bill will allow the government to have " a stranglehold on the media . " the standard has indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in kenya had " suffered a hard blow " and criticised the bill as " draconian . "
the adoption of the bill comes at the same time that a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed islamists in the commercial centre of westgate last september .
the kenyan media have angered the authorities by broadcasting images of cctv cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack supposedly shied away from the shopping mall .
the head of the police , david kimaiyo , has responded by calling two journalists and a media manager for the interview , although the invitation was withdrawn after an outcry in the media .
under the new bill , the media can be punished with fines of up to 20 million shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being " separated " or not being able to receive accreditation official press .
the court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if it has not paid his fine .
according to the daily nation , " even a single fine is enough to paralyze most fm stations . "
he also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the " lively blogosphere " of kenya .
by reducing the media into silence , politicians know they can do what they want with impunity .
" nobody will ever know , " wrote mutuma mathiu , journalist for the nation , describing the kenyan media as a source of key control in public life .
" left to themselves , politicians would bankrupt the country and push us to hunting and gathering . "
the kenyan legislators have been the target of the anger of the population in the past .
in may , they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the national commission in charge of wages and restored their windfall wages about 532000 shillings per month tax exempt – which are among the highest in the world .

an inhabitant of aubervilliers launches its suburban party
let us not fool ourselves .
in the spirit of abdel-malik djermoune , its founder , the " party of the suburbs " is not only to commuters .
i chose a map of france as its logo , justifies it .
when i talk about the suburbs , i address all those who are excluded from the national family .
nevertheless , his project , presented thursday at a press conference in his home commune of aubervilliers , was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism , that great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighborhoods .
my proposal n ° 1 is to create a department of multiculturalism , he says .
abdel-malik djermoune , 50 years , attached territorial claims today as apolitical " 100 % " even if it has not always been neutral .
activist in 2002 alongside jean-pierre chevénement , he then supported locally dominique de villepin between 2010 and 2011 .
i know that the values of equality that i advocate in my program are attached to the left , but if the right people are willing to support me , i will also listen , " he says .
there is only the extremist parties that i am not talking about .
in addition to multiculturalism , abdel-malik djermoune has built his program on the internet – from many themes expected to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially for young people : the right to vote for foreigners , the legalisation of cannabis , the civil majority at 16 years , the rehabilitation of the caretaker ...
it remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene " for the municipal elections in 2014 , it would be fair , " he says . "
it is a problem of time and money .
the party of the suburb should still be represented in aubervilliers through my candidacy and i also hope in other cities .

" and the support that i receive emails since yesterday is not all suburban " he says .

foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa might have to pass a test of " authenticity "
the government is currently studying the possibility of setting up a test of " authenticity " for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while he intends to extend the crackdown .
the test , if it is adopted , would be applied on a test intended to prevent 457 visas to be used to fill unskilled positions or as a roundabout way to bring his family and friends in australia .
a government discussion paper was unveiled today as the labor mp maxine mckew denounced the government rhetoric on foreign workers , saying that it might offend the neighbours of australia .
" the sensational declarations on " foreigners returning at the end of the queue " and " jobs for australians first " are an unpleasant return to a time when unions demanded a protected market , " she told the australia india institute today .
historically , this meant that the work of the whites had to be protected – and i would not be surprised that some countries in the region see as an echo to this historical artifact .
the working document presents the 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former immigration minister chris bowen .
the immigration minister brendan o ' connor , who was in sri lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss the trafficking of human beings , has implemented five of the recommended changes , the others are under consideration .
if the criterion of " authenticity " was adopted , a visa applicant could be controlled to know " if the job offer is genuine in the case where the candidate is a personal relationship or a partner of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsors . "
companies could also be required to report the number of holders of 457 visas after some of them , having had the intention to sponsor a small number of workers actually employed hundreds .
meanwhile , an asylum seeker sri lankan 35 years would be dead of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to christmas island this week .

the man was transferred urgently by the australian authorities to the hospital christmas island , where he died .

the judgment by the court of appeal means that physicians attending the ivg will require a " privilege " of admission to local hospitals .
the privilege of admission is the right to a doctor under membership hospital , to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre to deliver a diagnosis or treatment .
advocates of abortion contend that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the state 's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain the privilege of admission " for their practitioners .
in total , it would be nearly 22000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions .
on monday , a judge of first instance had found on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional .
but the attorney general of texas , the republican greg abbott , who ran for governor , has asked the appellate court to cancel the trial judgment blocking the application of the law .
a full hearing on this issue is scheduled for january .

not to mention a certain taste for risk : those who had not hesitated to pose nude on the glossy display in situations far more sulfur on the big screen .
an excerpt from nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the web : stacy martin appears in bed and full ecstasy with shia labeouf .
if the provocative filmmaker asked his players to put their modesty in the closet , he has resorted to professionals in the x for the most risqué sex scenes , before merging all digitally : body above the belt , it is the star ; below , the lining .
björk to charlotte gainsbourg , nicole kidman , lars von trier has a habit of pushing his actresses to their limits , always for the better .
stacy martin did not come to talk about it .
it has been five years since my father was erased from the world of the living .
at the beginning i have denied his death , i spoke to him at present ,
i was so afraid to forget or rather i did not know how i was going to continue to " attend " .
there is no recipe for moving the wall of the invisible and regain its own .
then , signs have emerged .
the first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while i drove .
another time , a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch its shows that leaves me more on the nightstand .
it is the image of my father smiled with me in my everyday gestures .
our mother died after his exhausting struggle against cancer .
at least that is what i thought when i found her body becomes void on the hospital bed to the crumpled sheets .
similarly , her funeral was a frigid farewell focused around the meagre light candles that framed his coffin .
i thought it was a party .
slowly , by small diurnal and nocturnal appearances , a little shy , a little erased , it quickly returned in my mind , as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thinking are believed in mourning .
and then , it was while showing me my own facets that i had not yet seen , masked by my relationship with her .
so i have learned and understood that i had no lost the person of my mother but simply a woman that i did not really know , a woman who embodied this person , during his stay in life .
in dying , this woman had perfect his life and the person that i loved , and here i was , the full .
this detour from the path of my life is the most unexpected and most beautiful .
it is a privilege to know that people loved never leave us .
i like my father , " as the inside out " apparently .
i have always said .
i never thought at the time .
i have had difficult relations with him until he becomes old , ill .
here , i have been afraid of him and i love it .
one day , he died .
for a long time , he accompanied me : when i quit , when i had fear , when i had bad ...
he spoke to me , constantly encouraged me , he lived my body .
i saw his hands looking at mine , i paid him my body .
but it was never indiscreet .
i could have a personal life .
i left my privacy .
it lasted a long time and then one day he is gone .
finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged , advised .
i do not know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible .
my parents are no longer but i constantly feel about me .
every event , every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because i always refer : what would you have said that they would have thought that they would have done ?
i constantly dream of them , perhaps not every night , but several times a week .
i often dream of last moments that i must share with them before it is too late , only , there is always something that prevents me from accomplishing this time .
i wake up often anxious when it happens to me and i feel deeply their absence .
sometimes i have dreams instead and are part of my history and indeed , they continue to live and to share my life .
on the eve of my ultrasound where i had to know the sex of my baby , i dreamed that i would wake up , i hissais out of bed , my father was waiting for me on the level and i smiled and exulted that i expected a little boy .
the next day , i had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep indicating to me that he shared with joy this was happening .
and , of course , it was a little boy in my belly .
i liked to share this moment with him and i am pleased to tell this common memory lived after his death .
there are precisely five years ago , my grandmother died of cancer .
a year ago , she was traveling with my family in cuba .
that is the shock that her disappearance resulted in the young bachelor that i was at the time .
despite everything i have achieved my mourning quickly enough .
but it continues to influence my life , especially when i am in trouble , or when i have to take important decisions .
learn arabic and my interest in the middle east , making for a master 's degree in high school , were not , with hindsight , innocuous choice .
in fact , i often heard arabic in my childhood , and talk of morocco , where she had lived for decades - before returning to france at independence .
the values she instilled me are always present , so that i sometimes think about how she would like me to act at a given time .
the same goes for my attitudes : i try to be at the height of the generosity and goodness of spirit that was a fervent believer .
now , i feel like a daily presence , a benevolent soul , an uplifting spirit .
i see his eyes alight on me .
my mother died there are nineteen years now .
dead after having spoken to me on the telephone .
i went through all the phases : misunderstanding , anger , pain , the tears that go off alone , anywhere , anytime , in unusual places , incongruous moments .
then , time has eased the pain .
it remained that lack this empty unanswered , this need for it , to assign me , reassure me in the palm of his sweetness .
yet it is here , silent presence , it is there and look at me .
every morning , i see his eyes worried landing on me , i see rings that encumber her eyes , wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes , folds that mark the front days of concern .
my mother has taken possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror .
and every morning i distracts the eye .
my wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43 years .
there is a continuous protection , nothing serious can happen to us .
it was his promise on his bed of pain , then it has gradually regain smile , and his name is no longer taboo , but a comfort .
of course , i speak to him in the palm of the night when the absence is too bad , she is invited onto my dreams when morale is a little achieved .
we feel encouraged and protected in difficult times , in retrospect we realize how important it was conductor and we are trying to remain in the way that it had drawn us .
if you enjoyed very strong , the absence cannot be removed from the heart and souvenirs .
in some ways , the beloved becomes your inner energy .
i lost my father on 22 august 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer .
i was very close to him , i have always acted according to what he thought or what he liked .
i was not able to attend her burial and three weeks after his death , i gave birth to a boy .
if i have my beliefs sometimes different , i always wonder if my actions are consistent with its vision of things .
i also had problems in my work for these convictions .
for me , it is impossible to go in the opposite direction , i do not sleep and i always wonder what it thinks .
i do not know if i adopted its way or if i am just like him : is it genetic ?
in any case , it will always be my reference .
it was a bit like an alter-ego , there was no need to talk among ourselves .
in short , it is here on a daily basis .
i feel his presence , and it makes me happy .
that is almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33 years .
i was 28 years old and our son 6 years .
the immense which then invaded has of course dampened but it is always close to me .
very often it " landed " in my dreams so precise , so alive that i am even sadder awakening to find that it was only a dream .
the other night , he asked me if i was okay , i told him no , i say " i descend " but a voice so real that i woke up in bed and anxious and i turned on the bedlight looking everywhere , convinced that he was going to happen .
i still live in the same house , and often i feel observed and i returned to see if he is not here , i know it is him and i talk to him .
in all the parts i feel his presence , and it makes me happy .
nothing in the world i would quit this house where we were happy , or his spirit lives with me .
i am 58 years old , i have always lived alone since his departure , it is and will remain the love of my life .
i would like to say that i am sociable with a profession of responsibility , i laugh and i sang , i go out , i am a grandmother , i have many friends , but my heart and my soul and i never speak to him except with my son , and i never go to the cemetery .

pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
the island of pitcairn wants to create the world 's largest marine reserve , announced thursday the newspaper les nouvelles de tahiti , containing information of radio australia .
this island , east of the gambier archipelago of ( french polynesia ) , is the last british territory in the south pacific , halfway between new zealand and chile .
this territory is 47 km2 , if there are three other small islands nearby .
it is the uk since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the bounty , episode in the history of the english navy , which led to three hollywood adaptations .
a few dozen people , most of them descendants of the bounty mutineers , still inhabit pitcairn and their incomes depend on 95 % of the generosity of london .
the island council has voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago , 836000 km2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone .
a deputy mayor of the island went to london to ask britain to validate the request .
mike warren , the mayor of pitcairn , believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for the island .
the project must be accepted by the english governor of pitcairn , residing in new zealand , and by the british government .
the creation of such a marine reserve would allow the uk to make these 836000 km2 , provided , however , have the means to ensure the monitoring , which is not the case .
there is no airport in pitcairn , making it impossible to build one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area , and there is no port where placing military surveillance vessels .
as for france , it must already lead the very expensive air and sea surveillance of five million km2 of the eez of french polynesia , pitcairn neighbour .

the parents of a teenager from georgia , who died in unusual circumstances , believe that their son was murdered
the parents of a georgia teenager whose body was found in a carpet of fight rolled in the gymnasium of the high school , believe that their son was murdered , said the family lawyer thursday .
kendrick johnson , of valdosta , georgia , was found on january 11 , stuck in a carpet supported standing behind the bleachers in the gymnasium of the high school .
investigators from the sheriff of the lowndes county concluded that johnson had died in unusual circumstances , but the family of the boy 17 years of disputes these conclusions .
" they are absolutely certain that their son was murdered , " said benjamin crump , the lawyer representing kenneth and jacquelyn johnson , on foxnews.com.
they have never thought it was dead as indicated in the conclusions of the sheriff .
" they think it defies any logic , the laws of physics and common sense , " said crump .
they are convinced that these conclusions were delivered with the sole aim to cover the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .
" they have sent their son to school with a binder , and it has made in a body bag , " he added .
the united states attorney michael moore said thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into the death of johnson , noting that several important questions remained unanswered .
what is the cause of death ?
his death is the result of a criminal act ?
moore was speaking at a press conference thursday afternoon .
i will follow the facts wherever they lead .
my goal is to discover the truth .
" i consider that there is a sufficient basis " to open a formal investigation , he said .
moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that johnson had died by " positional asphyxiation " .
however , a second autopsy has identified another cause of death , according to moore .
" several issues still deserve a response or confirmation , " he said .
moore added that if he uncovers evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into the death of johnson , he will ask the fbi to conduct .
the representative of the county sheriff 's office of lowndes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted thursday .
a judge in southern georgia ordered wednesday the authorities to hand over all cctv recordings that investigators had examined .
the parents of the teenager said they hoped that video images contain clues to the circumstances of his death .
the former head of the gestapo buried in a jewish cemetery
müller , who disappeared at the end of the second world war without never regains its track , has in fact been buried in a mass grave of a jewish cemetery in berlin , says the leader of the memorial of the german resistance , professor johannes tuchel in bild .
müller has not survived the end of the war .
" his body was buried in 1945 in a common grave in the jewish cemetery in berlin-mitte , " he assured the mass circulation daily based on archival documents .
this revelation , 68 years after the end of the nazi regime of adolf hitler , would meet one of the great riddles of the after-war .
the german secret service , the bnd , and were in the summer of 1949 , müller was in karlovy vary , then czechoslovakia , according to a document obtained by bild .
the secret services is totally wrong .
" in august 1945 , the body of müller was found in a temporary tomb near the former ministry of aviation of the reich by a commando , " according to mr. tuchel .
he wore " a general 's uniform . "
" in the left inner pocket included his service with a photograph , " he says .
bild also publishes a document 's municipal district of mitte district in berlin that he was buried in the jewish cemetery in the district .
the chairman of the central council of jews in germany , dieter graumann , said he was shocked by this revelation .
one of the most brutal nazi sadists is buried in a jewish cemetery , it is an enormity of bad taste .
" it grossly foot crowd the memory of the victims , " he protested in the newspaper .
heinrich müller is part of the important personalities of the third reich that have never been caught .
he attended the wannsee conference in january 1942 , which decided the " final solution " and notably under his command was adolf eichmann , responsible for the " logistics " of the extermination of jews , sentenced to death and executed in israel in 1962 .
egypt asks the first freely elected president sworn in
mohamed morsi swore the oath of investiture , but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of the political conflict in egypt .
the islamist mohamed morsi promised a " new egypt " when he swore the oath of presidential nomination , becoming the first freely elected president , succeeding hosni mubarak who was ousted 16 months earlier .
at his inauguration before the high constitutional court , mr morsi also became the first freely elected islamist president in the arab world and the fifth head of state to egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago .
he was sworn in front of the 18 judges in black robes of the court that the building located on the edge of the nile was built to resemble an egyptian temple .
" we aspire to a better tomorrow , a new egypt and a second republic , " morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television .
" today , the egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , " explained mr morsi , an engineer from 60 years formed in the united states , from the muslim brotherhood , a fundamentalist group for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments .
hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when mr morsi arrived shortly after 11.00 a.m. local time , followed by a small convoy .
only a few hundred supporters gathered before the court to cheer the new president , and the presidential splendour of the mubarak years , traffic has been interrupted only briefly to allow the passage of his convoy in busy streets linking downtown to the southern suburbs .
regarded as the " spare tire " uncharismatic of the muslim brotherhood , his personal prestige has risen considerably since his victory and his speech friday in which he has tried to portray himself as the candidate not only islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian president hosni mubarak .
" egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional and modern state , " said mohamed morsi , in blue suit and red tie , addressing the judges present in the room with woodwork where he was sworn in .
later , mr morsi went to the university of cairo , where he gave his inauguration speech .
he was officially welcomed by a military band played the national anthem when he went to attention .
marshal hussein tantawi attended the ceremony .
upon his arrival , he was greeted by the chant " the people and the army , hand in hand ... " intoned by thousands of people gathered in the main hall of the university .
founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education , the university of cairo later became a stronghold of islamist student groups in the 1970s .
mr morsi has made a symbolic oath on friday in tahrir square , where is the party uprising that ended the authoritarian mubarak regime last year , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council , which replaced the ousted former president , was dispossessed .
but by agreeing to formally take the oath before the court , rather than before parliament as is customary , bowing to the will of the army by showing that the power struggle is not over .
the speech by mr morsi in tahrir square was accompanied by populist dramatic gestures .
aircraft manufacturers squabble about the width of seats while big orders are at stake
the dispute is raging between the large aircraft manufacturers about the width of the seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the dubai airshow , which takes place in month .
the conflict is about the width of seats offered on long-haul flights in economy class passengers – which are not always the most courted by the airlines , but the space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest devices presented by airbus sas and boeing co .
this week , airbus has called on the aviation industry to implement a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 inches ( 45.72 cm ) in the economic classes , but its great us rival boeing said that it should be up to airlines to decide .
the dispute erupted when manufacturers seek to sell even larger versions of their long-haul aircraft twins , hoping eventually a record orders at the event which will take place from 17 to 21 november .
how the seats will be willing to the back of the plane – in particular , have 9 or 10 seats in front – is essential to the economic performance of the " mini-jumbo segment . "
boeing says its " 777x " redeveloped will accommodate in economy class 406 people in seats more than 17 inches wide , and will be configured with 10 seats per row .
airbus says that the version of its competing a350 will transport economy class 350 people in seats from 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9 .
the aviation giants often exchanging blows on technical issues by advertising in the press .
today , airbus is appealing directly to the public before the dubai airshow , where the 777x should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders .
it has been spotlighted recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation of a photo showing three people against each other in a restaurant , " do you accept it ? "
" boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats in the regional turboprop aircraft , " said john leahy , commercial director of airbus .
as dietary habits change , people grow , but the seats on planes have not changed radically .
between the early 1970s , when the jumbo boeing 747 has defined the long-haul trip , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average american from 40 to 49 years increased by 10 % , according to data from the u.s. department of health .
the size of the average american in the 21 century is 39.7 inches , according to u.s. statistics .
airbus says that his rival clings to a concept of seat that dates to the 1950s , when the circumference of the newly christened " jet set " was closer .
airbus says that it has commissioned a study which indicates that an additional boost to the width of seats would improve sleep quality by 53 % .
boeing disputed airbus 's figures regarding the width of seats and says that it is not manufacturers to decide how the airlines balance the ticket prices and equipment .
he also said that the study shows that the cabin experience depends not only on the width of the seats .
" it is really provide flexibility to airlines and allow them to do what they think they should do to carry out their activities , " said kent craver , in charge of passenger satisfaction among boeing .
they do not want to be told what they will be profitable .
they know their business better than anyone .
for passengers , it is more of a certain freedom of movement , but for suppliers , it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results .
behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders for an amount estimated at least $ 700 billion at market prices in the coming decades , enough to tilt the balance of american and european exports .
as reuters noted for the first time in july , the seating configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices .
airbus and boeing both claim a return by seat in their latest models of long-haul twin 20 % higher than the market leader in this segment , the boeing 777-300er of 365 seats .
the performance announced by boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777x configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin configured in rows of 9 .
the gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the aircraft configured with 10 seats per row currently in service .
" boeing made it to squeeze more seats and make its planes more competitive with our products , " said kevin keniston , director of passenger comfort in airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers were in favour of a denser configuration , which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares .
" a seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , the proposal of airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777 , " said the expert in cabin interiors mary kirby , founder and editor of runway girl network .
airbus and boeing does not provide seats , but offer a catalogue of suppliers including airlines must choose .
sellers of planes that go around the world prevail even with a metre to verify the competing configurations .
while extolling a comfortable , all manufacturers also offer planes with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and regional travel .
airbus offers a a350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold .
until recently , airbus highlighted the need for greater customization cabins by offering wider aisle seats on some of its planes .
without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern devices , experts say it is unlikely that his appeal to the aviation industry in order to establish a standard for the seats to succeed , but that it could overshadow the wave of sales of 777x .
the adaptation by guillaume nicloux 's novel denis diderot boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a painstaking reconstruction of time , but it is also more laborious than it should be .
in france the 1760s , she tells the grim story of suzanne , a young aristocrat sent in a convent by her family .
when she is rebellious , she faced the cruelty of a mother superior deliberately sadistic and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another .
the film never pays in the prurience and sensationalism , and it is the problem .
the conscientious solemnity of narration could also become a penance for the public .
the musical , this beast of scene
classic , sophisticated , popular , in english or french , productions sung and dansées fledge .
after broadway and london , paris finally found his voice .
it is a revolution : the french musical asserts itself as a kind of success .
long , notre-dame de paris to mozart opera rock , most attempts to empêtraient ridiculous .

today , these two scenes wielding titles as tubes to success .
the first resumed , this christmas , his excellent my fair lady and announcement of the creation of global " an american in paris . "
in mogador , beauty and the beast " may well be one of the success of the season .
on the other scenes , the musical performances as " 1789 , " " the lovers of the bastille " and small musicals as " disco " or " the life and times " are toasting the success and quality .
patrick niedo , author of the reference book " stories of musicals " and lecturer at the théâtre du châtelet , analyzes the reasons for the success if voltaire .
how the french are changing musical comedies ?
the offer is increased .
first there are the " music " that do evolve as producers ...
some use projections -beautiful images and a true story - as in 1789 , the amants de la bastille .
others made a leap of 15 years on the grounds that we can serve almost -anything when matt -pokora in headliner .
after , it was musicals with the sumptuous productions du châtelet -that we bring the golden age of broadway and discover the universe of stephen sondheim , the greatest living composer .
internship -entertainment popularized musicals anglo-saxon variety adapting them in french .
the french -independent producers seek a breakthrough .
but ongoing projects such as " rent , " " the kiss of the spider woman " or " spring awakening " - to be financed .
do we have enough artists as able to broadway singer , play and dance ?
in paris , when there are eight musical performances in a season , it is a great year .
we have 200 talented artists turning projects into projects .
the united states , birthplace of the musical , it is very different .
young people are trained in these trades in many schools .
jobs are plentiful among the regional theatres , touring broadway , off-broadway ...
the talent pool is also a result that the number of vacancies .
why touring in the province have so much success ?
with the exception of the opera , the province remains the poor relation of culture in france .
few plays touring and is often theatre boulevard - for adults and not for young adults .
the music fills the -lack .
it is these same young people who love reality television and what it produces as ephemeral stars ...
offer beautiful young men ( often talented ) headliner concert is the assurance of an appetite for these girls and often their entire family .
the facebook pages of these performances are cleverly -held by professionals who answer questions .
these performances are very expected when they arrive in a zenith province .
mayonnaise is mounted in paris and tasted by the provincial .
the show is designed to enter all the great halls of france in the same form as in paris .

ben greenman : tenth anniversary of the new york comedy festival : the new yorker
you could say that new york city is the place where the stand-up in america : there are almost 100 years , the vaudeville actor frank fay , who held the role of master of ceremonies at the palace theatre on broadway , began to tell jokes directly to the public , on the tone of the conversation .
innovation fay persisted over the years , to be repeated more recently by the new york comedy festival .
created and overseen by caroline hirsch , the founder of the club of stand-up carolinas , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 performances in small clubs and major theatres .
" most of the headliners have emerged in the carolinas , and have been a great success , until they have become too famous to play in a club , " said hirsch .

discovery of a drug tunnel between the united states and mexico with its own railway
one of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the united states and mexico , with its own lighting , ventilation systems and electric rails , was discovered .
the us authorities have described the tunnel by 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages that they had ever seen .
the tunnel , zigzagging on a length equivalent to nearly six football fields long , connects warehouses near tijuana , mexico , san diego , the united states .
the area is full of indefinable warehouses , which can easily conceal trucks loaded with drugs .
the tunnel was closed before the drugs are revealed in passing unnoticed , said the authorities .
authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel , according to court records .
three men who , according to the authorities , were working as drivers , have been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell .
they incur a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted .
in nogales , arizona , traffickers exploit vast subsurface drainage channels .
the tunnel is the eighth major crossing discovered in san diego since 2006 .
some of the biggest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central mexico in october , posing a challenge for the drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers .
in 2010 , the authorities have found a passage of about 700 yards with tracks that started in the kitchen of a house in tijuana and up to two warehouses in san diego .
syria has destroyed its production capacity of chemical weapons , says the oversight body
syria has destroyed the equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gas , said the international body monitoring chemical weapons thursday , while violent clashes raged in the north of the country , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
a group of syrian activists also said thursday that more than 120000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years .
the announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) arrived with a day ahead of the deadline of
november 1 , set by the organization based in the hague ordering in damascus to destroy or render unusable " all units of production of chemical weapons and machinery for mixing the toxic gas and ammunition .
the completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy chemical weapons in damascus by mid-2014 .
thanks to the destruction of the equipment , syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
however , damascus has yet to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves .
it is believed that the country has about 1000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons , including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin .
the announcement was made while the fighting raged thursday in the town of safira , which , according to experts , is home to a unit of chemical weapons production and storage sites , reported the syrian observatory of human rights based in britain .
the militant group , which follows the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in syria , said thursday that 120296 people had died .
among them , it is estimated that there were 61067 civilians , including 6365 children .
on the government side , it is estimated that 29954 members of the armed forces of president bashar al-assad died , including 18678 were fighters of the pro-government forces and 187 of lebanese hezbollah militants .
among the dead , it is also estimated that 2202 were deserters and some 5375 of opposition fighters , many of which were foreigners .
25 july , the un has estimated that 100000 people had died in the conflict since march 2011 .
it has not updated that figure since .
some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict .
the troops of al-assad are fighting against the rebels , many of which are linked to groups of al-qaeda network , safira for weeks .
the observatory said thursday that there were losses on both sides , but gave no detail .
the fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by the inspectors of chemical weapons while they must complete their mission to rid syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war , which continues under tight deadlines .
a statement of the opcw , which works closely with the un , indicated that his team was " now satisfied to have controlled – and destroyed – all production declared critical and machinery for mixing and filling . "
it added that " no other inspection activity was planned for the moment . "
earlier in the week , the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the audit work , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by damascus .
they have not been able to visit the two sites because of concerns about their safety , said the inspectors .
thursday , the opcw said that the two sites were , according to syria , " abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons program that they contained had been moved to other sites , which have been inspected . "
it was difficult to know at a glance whether the safira unit was one of two sites that the opcw inspectors have not been able to visit .
syria has submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved the following month by the executive committee of the opcw .
" i welcome the moral strength and the courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization , " said the director-general ahmet uzumcu , in a commentary published by the opcw .
now in its third year , the civil war between the mainly sunni muslim rebels in the assad government and its security forces , which are supported by members of the alawite sect , an offshoot of shiite islam .
on the other hand , the director of the syrian observatory of human rights stated that there had been a strong explosion wednesday in an air defence base in the coastal syrian province of latakia .
the cause of the explosion remains unknown , he added .
two ymca employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against jonathan lord , at a hearing of the royal commission .
two employees of the ymca nsw have been accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the educator of caringbah , jonathan lord , in 2011 , at a hearing of the royal commission in charge of sexual abuse of children .
but in his opening statement to the commission , the ymca said he " had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organization . "
the director-general phillip hare was questioned about two cases : a ymca employee was accused of offences relating to child pornography and a physical education instructor for the ymca caringbah hall was convicted of sexual assaults on children in the center where he worked in 1991 .
mr hare told gail furness , senior counsel with the commission , that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second .
he also admitted that the opening statement of the ymca was incorrect stressing , " ymca of external checks were completed and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization . "
it has been shown to the commission that the ymca had been informed that he had received the worst seconds appraisals on four institutions at a quality audit of the department of education and communities conducted in august of this year .
mr hare , who began working at the ymca at the age of 21 years , admitted that the management staff has been a failure with the recruitment of lord and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any breach of security policy .
earlier this year , lord was convicted of sexual assaults on 12 boys during the two years he worked at the ymca .
he was sentenced to 6 years in prison .
but mr. hare has rejected the idea that the ymca would have a cultural problem preventing staff to report breaches of lord towards the safety of children .
staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings , including the fact that lord was left alone with children , that he kept them in private , was sitting on his lap , said that he liked them and left them playing with his mobile phone .
danielle ockwell , who was mentored by lord and had sought training in child protection because it was concerned about his behaviour , said that it was responsible for the child of the ymca caringbah , jacqui barnat , which covered lord " very daunting and difficult to reach most of the time . "
the ceo said he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these violations to their supervisor .
instead , he said that the friendly relations they had with lord have scrambled their judgment , so that they have not reported his actions .
mr hare said he had expressed his views to the board of the ymca nsw saying that , for the organization , the lesson of " the jonathan lord incident " should not be " reporting " by staff , and the board agreed with him .
mr hare said that the decision to sign the staff confidentiality agreements , shortly after the allegations have been raised , was taken by the director general of the ymca for children 's services , liam whitley .
he said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an " excess of zeal " and that she had been poorly implemented .
the ymca of new south wales was not a safe organization for children at the time that jonathan lord was employed , namely between 2009 and 2011 , said the expert on sexual violence on children , professor stephen smallbone of griffith university before the commission .
he indicated that there were " serious problems " in the recruitment , testing , orientation , training and supervision of staff .
the hearing was adjourned until december 20 .
a ceremony in memory of the dead crématisés
the lachaise crematorium at 11.00 a.m. , a secular ceremony in memory of the dead crématisés in its establishment , during the year .
anne hidalgo , the socialist candidate for mayor of paris must attend , and then explains , during a press conference on its proposals for the funeral .
to attend the ceremony , click above .
for their own funerals , more and more french people choose cremation rather than burial : 53 % , according to an ipsos survey conducted on september 6 and 7 with 1009 people , instead of 47 % .
for the funeral of a close , it is the opposite : the french prefer interment ( 53 % vs. 47 % ) .
if they have the misfortune of losing a child , they are only 15 % to choose cremation .
in his book the death ash , damien le guay , philosopher and vice-president of the ethics committee of the national funeral , insists on the " violence " that cremation is , for the survivors .
there is , with cremation , " a violence liked the body , " which will be " reduced to a pile of ashes " in a very short time , and not after a process of decomposition , which " would accompany the stages of grief . "
there is also a " symbolic violence " , which is " the erasure of the singularity and distinctive signs " reduced to the " anonymity " of ash .
why should what is accepted in some nordic countries and protestants , it is still resented in france ?
" because cremation is a new fact , " says marie-frédérique bacqué , president of the society of thanatologie and author of the book taming the death .
it is tolerated since 1963 by the catholic church , which has limited attempts to tame .
taming cremation , it is for françois michaud-nérard , director general of the funeral services of the city of paris , a ceremony for the deceased as worthy as that to which he would be entitled to burial .
the annual ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony .
77 % of french people want one , for their loved ones , whether it is religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
now , 73 % of those who chose cremation to the organisation of a ceremony .
66 % atheists or non-believers want it too .
crematoria have adapted to the evolution of society .
" for a decade , they are trying to avoid the violence of a families waiting , without doing anything for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the presentation of the ashes , " observes mr michaud-nérard .
70 % of institutions now offer masters of ceremonies , who , in the presence of the body , the ritual : hosting the meeting , appoint the decedent , connect to others , the raise , give meaning to his death , organize the farewell .
this is the case in père lachaise crematorium since 1998 .
the masters of ceremony are often people who have switched .
there is also former catholic priests .
it is in this context that the lachaise crematorium has since 2010 , the day of the toussaint , ceremonies of remembrance , secular and non-religious , which it calls on the families of those who have been crématisées in the year .
for the second consecutive year , one of these ceremonies is rebroadcast online , to the attention of those who could not make the trip .
the crematorium has allowed to pass .
hagel accuses 9 us states to violate homosexuals rights
since the federal government recognized same-sex marriage , " all military spouses are entitled to an identity card from the defense department and the benefits that come with , " said the minister in new york in a speech to the anti-defamation league to combat anti-semitism .
" but some states refuse to issue the cards to same-sex couples in the facilities of the national guard " established on their territory , he denounced , criticising these states to violate the federal law and the principle of equality .
without these cards , these people cannot benefit from the many health or social services provided in these bases , or access to their stores .
the defense secretary said he ordered the head of the national guard , general frank grass , to ensure the implementation of the federal law .
the frond of nine states began with texas refuses to implement these benefits on implementations of the texas national guard , due to a dispute between texas and the federal law on homosexual marriage .

the pentagon believes the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to about 5600 active , 17000 people including the national guard , reserve and pensioners .
the price of oil continues to fall and approximates $ 96 per barrel
oil prices continued to fall friday as concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the chinese manufacturing sector gourmand electricity is being strengthened .
the price of benchmark u.s. crude for december delivery fell 14 cents to 96.24 a barrel in late morning in europe in electronic trading on the new york mercantile exchange ( nymex ) .
the contract lost 39 cents thursday , leaving it with a drop of 5.8 % for the month of october .
the abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks .
the us department of energy said wednesday that us supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .
over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels .
but two reports on the chinese manufacturing sector arrived friday , which showed a growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
this suggests that the economic recovery in china could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter .
brent crude , a benchmark for international crude already used by american refineries lost 26 cents to 108.58 a barrel on the inter-continental exchange ( ice ) in london .
back in black and white for marie chouinard , danse danse to its two new group choreography : the first inspired inks and poems of henri michaux , the second inspired by the famous piano solos gymnopédies satie .
an evening which can see all the prism of chouinard , art tics and ink black to white .
a white screen serves as a wall .
on the carpet , also white , in the vast space is the théâtre maisonneuve , juts profile , like a line and clad in black , a body .
on the screen , a henri michaux ink is projected .
the body , stroke , takes its form .
and this form will be that of the entire room : a string of physical imitations of drawings .
the dancers , dressed entirely in black , only the hands and face uncovered , expect each side of the playground , rush when the next spelling appears , embody , stand out .
this black and white game of henri michaux is relay solos , group in unison ( a mass that makes solo ) , large group of twelve solos where everyone performs his sign .
we think of morning glory , where solo , chouinard conducted a series of choreographic assignments written on cartels , posed online to the fore .
it is the same principle , giant version powerpoint .
here , the music is strong , percussion and electric guitars .
energy is high , always the rapid pace .
there will be breakage when carol prieur remaining under the carpet to dance , to deliver , microphone in hand , without sobriety and restraint , a part of the poem by michaux , monotonous and dull in the auction , and continue dancing .
and the music again , and the sequence to resume .
this sound discharge and energetic , long , if possible , eventually assourdir and numb .
as does the regularity of the visual rhythm .
there are some nice flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in chouinard - as these hair who ébouriffent or black fabrics that prolong the lines .
but the approach is choreographic composition .
one has the impression that the choreographer , instead of going to the meeting of michaux , emerged with its tics .
the result : the bodies appear to be flat in the drawings .
inks michaux , as forms of gestalt , open a broader and starvation that imaginary dance , more porous .
only the late , negative , with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre is the magic .
the public has liked , the reception was warm .
the gymnopédies , after intermission , is richer .
the scene is partly draped gray , dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics , such as furniture in an abandoned house .
the piano , dancers have rallied together to play the partitions .
their awkwardness in music , poignant , give a real fragility .
on stage , couples spend romantic duets , very sensual , even erotic .
group work , small solo transitions , moving ensembles , choirs , writing is less binary .
fools are appearing , as familiar to chouinard , wearing the red nose , in amorous displays very polarized gender .
the lovers are carnivores , evasion or players .
the gesture , laughter and small cries transpose the beautifully archaic , grace and ridicule of coitus , beings who are based .
but the piece takes its impetus from real salvation .
a clown is on the scene when the public leaves .
there , everything becomes permit : the fourth wall falls , the universe explored overlap , dancers cabotinent , down among the spectators , pontificate here , smoke , bypass , play codes of applause , stretches the sauce in a cleverly calculated mess that is sensual .
the joy and madness sweat , and it is the art of chouinard , contaminating the public .

report : the obama campaign considered dropping biden for hillary clinton
the closest advisors of president barack obama have envisaged in the greatest secrecy , to replace vice president joe biden for hillary clinton on the list of 2012 , according to the new york times .
this revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated book of the 2012 campaign by mark halperin and john heilemann , " double down : game change 2012 . "
the times obtained a copy of the book to be published thursday evening and told that the entourage of the president had conducted " extensive work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011 " to see if the eviction of biden could help obama in his re-election while his hopes have dwindled .
according to the political correspondent of the times jonathan martin , the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials of the campaign and the white house , namely the former secretary-general of the white house bill daley , to measure what effect the replacement of the vice president by the former secretary of state clinton on the ballot .
the possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the campaign hq in chicago and inside the oval office .
only a half-dozen close aides of the president – including daley , the former head of obama 's campaign , jim messina and former white house advisers david axelrod and david plouffe – knew that change was in the study .
" double down " indicates that daley has led the charge to replace biden , despite their " personal ties " , before finally deciding against the change when the figures have shown that having clinton on the presidential list " did not improve significantly the chances of success for obama . "
in an interview with martin , daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing biden by clinton .
" i said that i had examined a whole series of issues , and it was one of them , " daley told the newspaper .
remember that at that time , the president was not in form , and therefore we said , ' lord , what can we do ? "
while daley called the review of " concerted , " martin told anderson cooper of cnn that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to discover if the change would benefit at the polls .
" the campaigns do not spend a lot of money to polls and focus groups unless they are seriously considering taking action , " said martin on ac360 .
however , it is unclear whether obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement .
martin said on cnn that he had asked daley if his boss was aware of the potential realignment .
although daley has said he did not think that the president " was aware " of the possible change , the former secretary general admitted that it was " possible " obama knew .
martin added that " double down " did not definitively on the question of whether political pollsters had arrived on the obama office .
cooper asked martin if he seriously thought that obama did not know that the eviction of biden 's presidential list was being considered .
" maybe , " said martin .

cogeco cable may soon offer interactive television
subscribers of cogeco cable may well have access to applications such as facebook , twitter and ultimately the video-on-demand service netflix via their television in a future that does not seem so distant .
the subsidiary of cogeco said thursday that it was currently preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users .
" this will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options , " said president and ceo of cogeco , louis audet , in an interview .
cogeco cable is following its competitors , such as bell , even though the subsidiary cogeco does not yet have a precise date in relation to this new platform .
" we must adapt and change or resist change and fail , " said mr. audet .
the ultimate goal is to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access .
the telecommunications giant rogers has already indicated that it could offer netflix if some technical details , which have not been named , could be resolved .
the united states , the popular video service said to be in discussions with some major cable so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms .
the ceo of cogeco and cogeco cable also welcomed the announcement made by the harper government during his speech from the throne , on 16 october .
ottawa wants to force providers of cable television and satellite to offer customers the ability to pay for services to the card .
" it is almost two and a half years that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large bundles of channels , it does not work , " mr. audet said .
but he hopes that the consultations conducted by the canadian radio-television and telecommunications commission ( crtc ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
" it will emerge from these discussions , a kind of new reference framework to define our new canadian cultural policy in regard to television , " said the ceo of cogeco .
the crtc is conducting consultations with the public since the last week and they should continue with industry next spring .
on the side of the results , cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 cents per share .
it is a decrease compared to net profit of 44.9 million , or 83 cents per share , in the same period last year .
the montreal-based company said the decrease in depreciation costs related to new acquisitions .

it was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in portugal .
last december , the montreal company has also bought peer 1 network enterprises , an internet provider based in vancouver , for $ 526 million .
the income of cogeco , they grew by 41.5 % in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million .
they are 1.8 billion for the fiscal year .

for me , this is not an indication of a change in trend , " he observed .
it varies from one quarter to another with a fierce competition .
gazprom alexei miller said that the pipeline of bulgaria inaugurates a new era of gas
the beginning of the construction of the south stream gas pipeline in bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in europe , said the director of gazprom .
" a historic event took place today : construction began in the bulgarian part of the south stream pipeline , the large-scale project , the largest in europe , " said alexei miller , the ceo of gazprom , in a statement thursday .
this project is a key element of the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is expected to diversify export routes from russia to europe .
a contractual dispute between gazprom and its ukrainian counterpart , which handles the bulk of russian gas to europe , increases the level of risk relative to conventional routes , adds the director .
miller added that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated " forever . "
the bulgarian consumers will receive the south stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project will be put into service in 2015 .
gazprom said that the construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year .
the pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas .
strangers at a hotel near the pyramids in cairo
hooded vandals opened fire friday on a hotel near the pyramids in cairo in egypt without any casualties , a result of an apparent feud with laid-off employees .
the attackers fled , said the spokesman of the ministry of the interior , the police general abdel latif .
the attack comes as egypt receives virtually no tourists since the army deposed islamist president mohamed morsi in early july and represses in blood manifestations of his supporters .
schools are encouraged to focus more on math , spelling and grammar
in the context of english literature , students will study at least one shakespeare play , a novel of the 19th century , a romantic poem and a contemporary british fiction of 1914 to the present .
the review will also present " new texts " to encourage a more diverse reading .
a course combining literature and english language will be deleted .
from 2015 , pupils will have to pass an independent language gcse , and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in english literature .
the ministry of education tomorrow must publish its new programs of english and maths – the first material to undergo a radical overhaul .
it will make changes in other basic materials next year .
furthermore , ofqual , the exams regulator , will unveil an overhaul of the gcse structure , with a new scoring system and fewer courses .
speaking during the summer , michael gove , education minister , said that there was a " broad consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , " insisting that the gcse would be " more challenging , more ambitious and more rigorous . "
studies show that english schools spend less time math ( 116 hours per year , or 3 hours per week during the school year ) than most other countries .
in comparison , the australian schools on average 143 hours per year , and students in singapore are about 138 hours .
although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time use math , sources close to the coalition government indicated that the gcse maths deepened – as well as the greater importance attached to matters contained in the international rankings – probably would encourage schools to ensure more hours .
the program will put more emphasis on the " problems of the real world , " including financial mathematics .
the european elite is ready to do business with britain ?
the business for britain campaign was launched in april with a promise to bring businesses and to define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the eu .
to this end , we commissioned the investigation the broadest and most complete with british managers and asked what they thought of britain , businesses , and the eu .
yougov interviewed more than 1000 business leaders , broadly representative of all sizes of firms , sectors and regions of britain .
the conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise to many .
we discovered that the vast majority of companies now seek to export outside europe , focusing on those countries that are modernizing and develop while eu states are stagnant .
they want to see the government give priority to new commercial ties with countries such as china , india and brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the european institutional arcana .
when asked their opinion on specific political issues – ranging from regulating monopolies to laws on products – the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key competences should return to the hands of westminster .
the single market has caused a general discontent , companies saying that the cost of the brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits that there has to be part of the european exchanges – 40 % of big business , traditionally the most pro-european , are even agree .
finally , and what is more telling , our survey of business leaders found that a substantial majority wanted to see britain pursue initiatives in favour of a change in the treaty and the development of a relationship with the eu based on trade and not politics .
this conclusion , which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes , shows that the business world insists on a " significant change " that restores the power in the uk .
the stakes are high – to change the treaty and better represent the interests of britain would see a swing of 16 % of the votes in favour of keeping the country in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should not doubt for a moment : the survey shows that british businesses support the plan to renegotiate the terms of the accession of britain to the eu .
it also shows that companies are hoping that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the united kingdom .
it is possible , and increasingly necessary , to better represent the interests of british companies , since the eurozone is committed to the path of closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain and , as the conclusions of our investigation show , for businesses that means renewed emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in brussels .
beijing involves a turkmen islamic movement
" the behind the scenes to support the attack came from the east turkestan islamic movement , based in west and central asia , " said the boss of chinese security bodies to a television channel in hong kong , according to a video thursday evening on a website .
meng jianzhu , who is a member of the political bureau of the communist party of china ( cpc ) , was speaking in tashkent during an official visit to uzbekistan .
this is the first time that a chinese official designates a particular organization , following the attack on monday .
according to the chinese police , three uighurs of the same family of the region 's dominant muslim xinjiang border , several central asian countries , have hastened their car loaded jugs of gasoline against the entry of the forbidden city in beijing , in a suicide attack in which two people were killed and 40 wounded .
the driver of the car , his wife and his mother died in the fire of the car .
the etim , who says fighting for the independence of east turkestan , a former xinjiang chinese name , has been classified by the un in 2002 among the organisations affiliated to al-qaeda .
this movement is often designated by the chinese authorities as being responsible for sporadic unrest in xinjiang , but his real influence is questioned by several experts .

but the fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has not passed unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , including by increasing gas prices to the population .
after another unsuccessful mission in the country , the imf noted this week that " the large external financing needs , " constituted " a vulnerability , " " signs of economic improvement . "
however , for the economist oleksandr joloud , of the centre for policy studies , " we cannot expect an improvement in the short term . "
" there is little hope that unpopular reforms are undertaken in a pre-election year , " the presidential elections in 2015 , is the expert , asked afp .
the only hope is an improvement of the international situation .
n is also " uncertainty " linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between ukraine and the eu , that brussels prepares for the release of the opponent yulia tymoshenko .
" signing the agreement would be positive for trade in the long term , but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium terms related to russia 's reaction , " explained s , which fears " trade restrictions " on the part of moscow .
russia , which represents a quarter of ukrainian exports , warned that in the creation of a free trade area between the eu and kiev , it should strengthen its controls at the border for the imported goods .
pawnshops singapore benefit middle-class constraints to tighten their belts
in a pawnbroker mall bendemeer singapore , janani amirthalinga files a bracelet , a ring and a pair of earrings in gold to pay tuition for his daughters .
" my husband and i just bought a house so all my money has gone into it , " says amirthalinga .
although she earns $ 3000 singapore ( $ 2400 ) per month as an administrator and that her husband also works , the monthly family income is not enough , " she says .
in fact , the demand is such in parts of south-east asia – where household debt increases – that valuemax , where it conducted its transaction , this week became the third company pawn loans to be introduced on the singapore stock exchange .
pawning jewellery is not just a quick way to get cash – $ 1300 of singapore in the case of mrs amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as the unsecured bank loans .
in general , pawnshops singapore impose effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % offered by the united overseas bank , a lender with a local branch in the same mall .
however , pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary , and can unblock loans faster than banks .
consequently , millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops while families are feeling the pressure of the rising cost of living and the indebtedness of households and consumers .
after five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis , and the cheap credit fuelled by lax monetary policy in advanced economies , low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to bridge the difference while their economies are experiencing a slowdown .
this week , the rating agency standard & poor 's cited the growing household debt , resulting primarily from the increase in mortgage loans , as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of asian banks .
she said that malaysia , thailand and singapore showed the ratio of household debt / gross domestic product , the highest in asia .
malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 % of gdp , while the rate was 60 % in 2008 .
economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which left little this week of a technical recession .
on thursday , data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand .
" the bottom line is that with rising costs , people in the middle or at the bottom [ of the wage scale ] seek to supplement their income as they can , " said song seng wun road , an economist at cimb , a malaysian bank .
the historically high price of gold over the last two years have proved that people were quick to pledge their personal effects to receive the cash value of their jewellery .
in singapore , about 70 % of the articles pledged in the 200 shops of pawning the city-state are in gold .
people say , " the price of gold is high , are pawned the gold chain of grandmother and will seek the next month . "
in thailand , the largest operator of boutiques of pawning , easymoney , recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months .
the increase is such in pawning that valuemax , operator of the shop in bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in singapore , plans to develop not only in neighbouring malaysia , where it already has four shops – but also outside of asia , says yeah lee ching , its ceo .
the company will using 60 % of the $ 66 million in singapore that it has removed this week when it was introduced on the singapore stock exchange .
while some lenders to reduce rates were criticised for the exorbitant interest rates they charge , miss yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders , but it does not directly increases the debt .
" clients mortgage assets they already have , and monetize their personal property does not increase household debt , " she says .
the pledge is accepted socially as a means to obtain a guaranteed short-term financing .
people who visit pawnshops are not only those who have financial problems .
affluent people of singapore are also in the boutiques of pawning valuemax for pawning gold bars or rolex watches , which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase price in cash .
we see customers from all walks of society .
" this may be the affluent people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments , or small businesses that have cash needs for a difficult course , " added miss yeah .
sometimes , they just need money very quickly .
the lawyer who is cocaine-crazed informed a godfather of the drug in a police investigation was imprisoned
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information to the crime lord neil scarbrough
the lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction is exposed
he was sentenced to a prison sentence of three years by the assize court in liverpool
a large defence lawyer , who had informed a godfather of the drug a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs is revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave sensitive information to the crime lord neil scarbrough concerning investigations into its activities related to drug trafficking after being compromised because of his habit of using cocaine .
the lawyer , who was nicknamed " bash " and regarded by criminals as a " matter of primary importance , " was arrested at his home in 2011 after bugging operations of police headed to scarborough , which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
police officers spotted sarborough , 32 , in the process of filing three bags of cocaine in the home of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , while attending a dinner of the bar with colleagues .
investigations revealed that ditta was a " regular " consumers of the class a drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair , on his portfolio and his credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he sought to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his associates .
the four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the counties of lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west yorkshire .
with 32 other men , they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million , and more than £ 200000 in cash in a series of raids .
ditta , 42 , was providing information to criminals because he feared that his addiction is exposed .
today , the assize court in liverpool , ditta , who works in the law firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , fell into disfavor after he was convicted on two counts of obstructing justice after a three-week trial .
he had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing .
the fall of the lawyer occurred after police , investigating scarborough , discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with ditta in february 2011 .
two investigators have followed the suspect and spotted arriving at the home of ditta and placing drugs , pure to 60 % , in the dustbin of the lawyer in a black glove golf .
shortly after the filing , scarborough has been in regular telephone contact with ditta , who was at a dinner at the football stadium to ewood park , pregnant club blackburn rovers .
the lawyer returned home , discovered the drug and they are telephoned nine times .
the court heard that ditta was a " regular " consumer of cocaine after tests showed traces of the class a drug in his hair , on his portfolio and his credit cards .
ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine . he said that he had spoken to the trafficker assumed because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a " legal privilege " .
during his arrest , ditta picked its portfolio and tried to remove several credit cards , but they have all been seized and he was selected a sample of hair .
during an interrogation , he said that he had an office in his home , as well as his place of work and sometimes when customers call the home to legal issues .
but the court heard testimony that he called the major players in the drug trade , some of which he had represented , after key arrests to tell them what investigators were informed .
the prosecutor anne whyte said : " if someone needs to know that we should not violate the law , it is a criminal lawyer . "
mr ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer , and being too involved with particular clients .
the relationship that we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer supplying the drug to his own lawyer .
some of its communications will undoubtedly legitimate communications because it was her lawyer .
but it went well beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client .
it has hampered the investigation by the police as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities .
mr ditta has not lived up to his profession , but was disgraced .
it is too close to some customers , especially scarborough , and he has left compromising its independence .
ditta has denied any wrongdoing and said : " if i were a corrupt lawyer , what i am not , and if i had wanted to provide information to mr. scarborough , i would not have waited 15 hours , i would have done it immediately . "
but after the hearing , the superintendent lee halstead of the lancashire police said : " mr ditta grew from criminal lawyer to criminal itself when it began to buy drugs from criminal organizations . "
his addiction to cocaine has compromised forever and made it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of organised criminal groups who have instructed to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers should observe the highest standards of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public .
mr ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession .
the unit responsible for the serious and organised crime in lancashire has led the investigation into mr ditta , who was convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and obstructing justice , demonstrating its commitment to pursue the criminals to justice .
that this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that nobody is above the law .
we will find you and you will translate to the courts .
scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking of heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking .
on its site , ditta held a session of questions and answers on himself when he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in america , his last dinner guest would be mohammed ali and inequality would be what would motivate the work .

a difficult year for pharmacists
the departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the centre for health and social services ( csss ) of laval caused quite a stir at the direction of the hospital of the city of health , in the year 2012-2013 .
because multiple retirements , maternity leave or any short separations , the pharmacy department was suffer a shortage of staff .
it was nearly 30 % strength , making this financial year " very difficult " , according to the head of the department , gillian beaudet .
however , the csss has decided not to hire independent workforce , which can cost up to three times more expensive than a full-time pharmacist .
it has not been used in the shooting , mrs beaudet explained .
it has streamlined or decreased some of our activities within the establishment for the time that things would sort themselves out .
it is certain that it has worked hard to engage our young people [ residents ] pharmacy to come and stay here .
there is a set of circumstances that has meant that we were in a bad situation last year .
improved situation
after this difficult period , the year 2013-2014 looks much easier for the pharmacy department of the csss .
already , three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and other three pharmacists were hired in recent months .
in addition , the efforts made by the department to retain have borne fruit , as the four students currently in residence at laval have also decided to remain on the job of the csss .
now , it is much better , said the pharmacist .
by the end of the financial year , we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns .
this will fill our departures last year .
increasingneeds
however , the situation remains delicate .
several factors , such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the profession , make situations such as that experienced in 2012 that are difficult to predict .
for us [ the numbers ] is always precarious , because it was an environment that is young and it employs many young women with pregnancies , drive almost always three maternity leave when it goes well , she added .
last year , there has been much more and there has been no pharmacists that are available to make replacements , so it was more difficult .

anger at the sentence against one of the bali bombers
survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the bali bombings in 2002 have reacted angrily to the sentence passed against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice , saying that umar patek should be shot by a firing squad .
patek , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in southeast asia , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks .
it could be released after 15 years on parole .
the 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of kuta , which killed 202 people , including 88 australians , and many injured .
he was also convicted of other charges in connection with terrorism , including a wave of attacks on churches across indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
prosecutors requested a sentence of imprisonment , yet they could ask that the man , described as " demolition man " for his reputation as an expert in manufacturing bombs , sentenced to death .
the decision has reignited the painful memories for june corteen , a perth mother who lost her two twin of 39 years , jane and jenny , in the destruction perpetrated by patek and other conspirators almost 10 years .
on the verge of tears , she said that patek should have been sentenced to death .
i really think that he should have followed the same path as other men .
" it should be dragged before the firing squad , " said mrs corteen paa .
i have to live every day without other grandchildren , nor see my daughters .
the sari club was destroyed when a huge bomb , loaded into a van parked outside , exploded just after 11pm on october 12 , 2002 .
peter hughes was at paddy 's bar when a suicide bomber has detonated a backpack loaded with explosives barely 20 seconds earlier .
he fell into a coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month , and it is " dead " three times while he was under respiratory assistance .
mr hughes said that patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of jemaah islamiyah responsible for the carnage – amrozi , mukhlas and imam translate by samudra – who were executed four years ago .
in fact , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
keep it alive , why , there is no reason to keep it alive .
spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injured hundreds of others , this is not a lot .
patek is the last of the bali bombers to be brought to justice .
he had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces kill the former leader of al-qaeda , osama bin laden , less than four months later .
during the trial , an fbi agent said that intelligence reports had shown that patek was in pakistan to meet with bin laden in order to restore links between terrorist groups in southeast asia and al-qaeda .
" it did not , " added mrs corteen .
until recently , it is fantastically taunted the grief he had caused to others .
the verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in bali and australia .
" there will be a lot of tears this year , " said mrs corteen .
but patek may appeal his conviction .

the leader of the pakistani taliban killed by a drone
the leader of the movement of pakistani taliban , hakimullah mehsud , was killed in a drone strike friday in pakistan , american has been learned from the security services .

" we can confirm that hakimullah mehsud was killed in a drone fire , " said a senior security official .

imbroglio around the emergency closure of the hôtel-dieu
faced with the frond conducted for several months by some of the personal and several unions , including the cgt , the health minister , marisol touraine , decided on july 10 to " shift the timetable for implementation of the project , and in particular the closure date of emergencies which can intervene on 4 november . "
a formal request " to not to take any risks on the management of emergencies in paris at the beginning of the winter " but was also not to hinder the campaign of the sp in a few months .
despite the ministerial instructions , the closure should be effective on that date .
even if , aphp , we prefer to use the term " transformation " or " change in continuity . "
as of november 4 , firefighters  who provided about a quarter of the 40000 annual emergency of the hôtel-dieu  will all have instructed to take the 30 serious cases per day to the other hospital emergencies in paris .
this date of november 4 is also the renewal .
the hôtel-dieu , specialized internal emergencies will leave monday to five general internal medicine .
with regard to the transfer of internal medicine beds , it is scheduled for later this month .
" the host service emergencies of the hôtel-dieu must close in the shortest time , and for us , it is on november 4 , " says bluntly loïc capron , president of the medical committee of establishment ( cme ) aphp , which supports the project management .
" on november 4 , there will be more patients brought by firefighters , only from people in their own way , " says professor jean-yves fagon , the medical director of the new hôtel-dieu .
" but we will continue to receive emergency patients , " he qualifies , arguing the permanent presence of the smur vehicles in place to transfer the serious cases .
emergency doctors seniors will stay , " he says .
but it is up to the lra to decide the closure of the home emergencies .
" things are gradually , " says nicolas péju , spokesman for the lra to which , on 4 november , " there will be no change in terms of service . "
" the minister has lied and he lied , " deplores the emergency department doctor gérald kierzek .
removed from his position as head of the smur early july for having conducted the frond against the reorganization project , it is defined as a " launcher " alert against a " cynical decision " by " the medico-administrative technostructure . "
" they are empty and asphyxiate emergencies that have been renovated less than five years , " he says .
for him , " if the other parisian emergencies could absorb the surplus , there would be no problem . "
but they are regularly clogged .
for example , there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for emergencies to lariboisière .
the lra , it argued that " thirty patients " dispatched on several sites are not likely to represent an " avalanche " in other emergency services , including human resources have also been strengthened .
has the lra as aphp defends the " new model " hospital underway since 7 october and should continue to host 30000 to 35000 patients per year .
by the end of the year , gps liberals should also participate in the establishment of a " permanent ambulatory care . "
" where are we if we are asking people to self-diagnose " asked gérald kierzek , for whom " the concept of not serious emergency " is " dangerous " and marks a " medical regression . "
it is going to happen as maternity wards level 3 .
people are not crazy , they will go where there is the best offer of care .
if the minister does not by monday , we will change gear , warns christophe prudhomme , emergency department physician and member of the cgt health .
we will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will reflect on a list .
in the team of nathalie kosciusko-morizet , vincent roger , an adviser to ump in paris and elected the 4th arrondissement , announces clearly that " even if the ump in paris was for the maintenance of emergencies at the hôtel-dieu , it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen if it is up to the responsibilities . "
anne hidalgo , candidate ps , has again reminded monday morning on france inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there is no closure on 4 november .
if this were the case , it would mark its net disagreement , said bruno julliard , its spokesman .
even if the restructuring of the hôtel-dieu has its legitimacy on the substance , we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals .

pope francis will appoint its first cardinals in february
pope francis will name new cardinals of the catholic church for the first time on 22 february , announced the vatican thursday .
the cardinals are men of church higher-ups in the catholic church behind the pope , and those who elect therefore françois will appoint its first group of men who ultimately will choose his successor .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , as soon as a cardinal reached the age of 80 , he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – it is about a group of 120 cardinals " voters . "
in a statement announcing the new , father federico lombardi , the vatican spokesman , said that a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of a cardinal , known as the presbytery .
" pope francis has decided to communicate its decision to convene the presbytery of february in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different parts of the world , " said lombardi .
jack valero catholic voice said that by february , the number of cardinal electors will probably declined .
he said that a pope named in general as many cardinals that it took to make the number of cardinal electors reaches 120 and cardinals older than 80 years he wanted .
the presbytery of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of pope francis in march of this year , said valero .

the cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since françois formed the council of cardinals , a group of eight cardinals around the world to examine ways to reform the church .
previously , the pope decided alone .
" now , françois chose the eight cardinals to help him , " said valero .
he added that he was " quite possible " that francis asked council cardinals .
but we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new .
valero said that popes were generally bishops represent large communities to the rank of cardinal , but that francis was " full of surprises – so we do not know who he will appoint . "
